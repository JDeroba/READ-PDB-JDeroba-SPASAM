abstract = {Recruitment often varies substantially in fish populations, and residual variability may have serial autocorrelation due to environmental effects even after accounting for a stock–recruitment relationship. However, the likely magnitude of variability and autocorrelation in recruitment has yet to be formally estimated. We therefore developed a hierarchical model for recruitment variability and autocorrelation and applied it to data for 154 fish populations. Results were similar when using either the Ricker or Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment model, and showed that autocorrelated recruitment has a marginal standard deviation of 0.74 (SD = 0.35) and a mean autocorrelation of 0.43 (SD = 0.28) when predicting for an unobserved taxonomic order. Estimates differed somewhat among taxonomic orders and stocks, and also supported a hypothesized positive relationship between age at maturity and autocorrelation in recruitment. Our results can be used as a Bayesian prior for recruitment variability in models for data-po...},

abstract = {Error bars commonly appear in figures in publications, but experimental biologists are often unsure how they should be used and interpreted. In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

abstract = {Linear regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are two of the most widely used statistical techniques in ecology. Regression quantitatively describes the relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous independent variables, while ANOVA determines whether a response variable differs among discrete values of the independent variable(s). Designing experiments with discrete factors is straightforward because ANOVA is the only option, but what is the best way to design experiments involving continuous factors? Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with ANOVA, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression? We recommend that ecologists choose regression, especially replicated regression, over ANOVA when dealing with continuous factors for two reasons: (1) regression is generally a more powerful approach than ANOVA and (2) regression provides quantitative output that can be incorporated into ecological models more effectively than ANOVA output.},

@article{Siegfried2009,
abstract = {In 1996, the United States Congress updated the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA), which calls for the minimization of bycatch, an attention to efficiency, and the use of the best available science. My work addresses those demands in three distinct ways. First, life history parameters of stock assessment models must be estimated using either statistical tools or functional forms based on physiological or ecological theory. I use Bayesian methods to fit the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation (VBGE), a function used to model individual growth, and the instantaneous natural mortality rate, M. I also develop a Bayesian model to find asymptotic size from the VBGE without size-at-age data. Life history theory provides a number of ways to calculate natural mortality. I test these methods on both simulated and real data. In general, weight- and age-based methods provide very different estimates for the same data than the methods based on individual growth rate and age at maturity. Second, the effectiveness of fishery management is judged both by the abundance of stocks and the continuing yield for fishers. Marine reserves are in the limelight of fishery management as a potential panacea for management, but analyses of the fishery effects of marine reserves are sparse. I review the literature for specific fishery benefits of reserves designed for a single or multispecies effect. I find little consensus on larval export, spillover, or density dependent mechanisms and their effect on fisheries outside the reserve. Third, the SFA calls for the immediate minimization of bycatch, and when practicable, that the mortality of that bycatch be minimized. I address this question by conducting an analysis of bycatch policy. I focus on the fish component of bycatch and I review the implementation and the effectiveness of various bycatch policies in the United States. Such policies require the use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), time/area closures, and gear modifications.},

@article{Torres2011,
abstract = {Marine invertebrate larvae suffer high mortality due to abiotic and biotic stress. In planktotrophic larvae, mortality may be minimised if growth rates are maximised. In estuaries and coastal habitats however, larval growth may be limited by salinity stress, which is a key factor selecting for particular physiological adaptations such as osmoregulation. These mechanisms may be energetically costly, leading to reductions in growth. Alternatively, the metabolic costs of osmoregulation may be offset by the capacity maintaining high growth at low salinities. Here we attempted identify general response patterns in larval growth at reduced salinities by comparing 12 species of decapod crustaceans with differing levels of tolerance to low salinity and differing osmoregulatory capability, from osmoconformers to strong osmoregulators. Larvae possessing tolerance to a wider range in salinity were only weakly affected by low salinity levels. Larvae with a narrower tolerance range, by contrast, generally showed reductions in growth at low salinity. The negative effect of low salinity on growth decreased with increasing osmoregulatory capacity. Therefore, the ability to osmoregulate allows for stable growth. In euryhaline larval decapods, the capacity to maintain high growth rates in physically variable environments such as estuaries appears thus to be largely unaffected by the energetic costs of osmoregulation.},

abstract = {Marine fisheries management is a complex process incorporating fisheries biology and stock status information, food web and predator/prey relationships, habitat needs, socioeconomic needs of recreational and commercial fishermen, and law enforcement issues. Understanding how all of these factors interact is a challenging task, even for experts in fisheries science and management. The purpose of this document is to explain the fisheries biology and stock status parts of the equation. It is intended for fishermen and other stakeholders interested in fisheries management issues, and serves as a primer for the technical basis of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's decision-making process. The following pages provide an overview of fisheries population dynamics (Chapter 1), fundamental data sources for fisheries stock assessments (Chapter 2), fish biology and life history information (Chapter 3), stock assessment concepts and principles (Chapter 4), common stock assessment models (Chapter 5), biological reference points and their use in gauging stock health and the effectiveness of management measures (Chapter 6), and how these elements fit into the Commission's fisheries management process (Chapter 7). The guide closes with a glossary of common fisheries language, including all terms in bold text found throughout the document. This publication explains some technical aspects of stock assessments that may be unfamiliar to those not directly involved in fisheries science and the analysis of fish populations. In particular, it is designed for stakeholders involved in Commission activities that have never been exposed to formal fisheries science training, but are asked to comprehend and interpret complicated fisheries concepts. An enhanced knowledge of fisheries science and assessment concepts will promote a better understanding of fisheries management, will promote more informed decision making, and will give stakeholders greater confidence in their significant role in the management process.},

abstract = {1. The power-law dependence of metabolic rate on body mass has major implications at every level of ecological organization. However, the overwhelming majority of studies examining this relationship have used basal or resting metabolic rates, and/or have used data consisting of species-averaged masses and metabolic rates. Field metabolic rates are more ecologically relevant and are probably more directly subject to natural selection than basal rates. Individual rates might be more important than species-average rates in determining the outcome of ecological interactions, and hence selection. 2. We here provide the first comprehensive database of published field metabolic rates and body masses of individual birds and mammals, containing measurements of 1498 animals of 133 species in 28 orders. We used linear mixed-effects models to answer questions about the body mass scaling of metabolic rate and its taxonomic universality/heterogeneity that have become classic areas of controversy. Our statistical approach allows mean scaling exponents and taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling to be analysed in a unified way while simultaneously accounting for nonindependence in the data due to shared evolutionary history of related species. 3. The mean power-law scaling exponents of metabolic rate vs. body mass relationships were 0.71 [95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 0.625-0.795] for birds and 0.64 (95{\%} CI 0.564-0.716) for mammals. However, these central tendencies obscured meaningful taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling exponents. The primary taxonomic level at which heterogeneity occurred was the order level. Substantial heterogeneity also occurred at the species level, a fact that cannot be revealed by species-averaged data sets used in prior work. Variability in scaling exponents at both order and species levels was comparable to or exceeded the differences 3/4-2/3 = 1/12 and 0.71-0.64. 4. Results are interpreted in the light of a variety of existing theories. In particular, results are consistent with the heat dissipation theory of Speakman {\&} Kr{\'{o}}l (2010) and provided some support for the metabolic levels boundary hypothesis of Glazier (2010). 5. Our analysis provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the scaling relationship between field metabolic rate and body mass in individual birds and mammals. Our data set is a valuable contribution to those interested in theories of the allometry of metabolic rates.},

We evaluated the potential of age pigrnents (iipofuscins) sequestered in neural tissue of eye-stalks and brains to estimate the age of blue crabs coilected frorn Chesapeake Bay and Chincoteague Bay. The rate of lipofuscin accumulation was determined using crabs of known age reared in the laboratory. Age pigments were extracted from neural tissues (eye-stalk or brain). quantified, and normalized to protein content to al.low cornpansons across tissue types and crab sizes. Fieldcollected blue crabs (35 to 185 mm carapace width) contained highly variable levels of age pigments (coefficient of variation = 58{\%}). Lipofuscin level was significantly related to carapace width, but not significantly different between gender or sarnpling location. In luveniles (40 to 70 mnl carapace width) reared for 6 mo, the age pigments showed no significant change during the rapid surnrner growth period, but significantly increased dunng fall (after 3 mo). Lipofuscin contents in known-age reared crabs were positively related to chronological age. Modal analysis of lipofuscin for field-coiiected adult males provided separation of multiple modes, whereas carapace width showed only a single broad rnode. These results confirm the potential use of Lipofuscin for age estimation of blue crabs.},

abstract = {We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta-ecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {The metabolic rates of a wide size-range of the rock lobster Jasus lalandii (20-3 000 g wet mass) over a temperature range covering normal annual fluctuations (8-19° C) were studied, and this information was used to estimate the energy demands at population level. Overthe studied temperature range and at standard rates of oxygen consumption, J. laland;; had a QIO value of 2,5. Plotted for five temperatures, the graph of oxygen consumption rates had a typical sigmoidal appearance, with a flatter response (QIO = 1,7) between 10 and 13°C, which coincides with the modal habitat temperature. At 19°C, the animals appeared stressed and showed an easing in respiration rate, with QIO = 1,4. Respiration is mass-dependent, metabolic rate being inversely proportional to body mass. Responses to a short-term drop in temperature of 5°C produce a rapid decrease in consumption rate of oxygen, with no undershoot occurring and with no suggestion of acclimation taking place. An increase of 5° C also induced a rapid response which resulted in an overshoot, followed by a gradual return over 2-5 days to the predicted rate, which could not be interpreted as one of acclimation. For a population of rock lobsters off Robben Island, north-west of Cape Town, at a mean annual temperature of 13°C, animals metabolize, on average, the equivalent of their body mass of carbon each year. This represents an irreversible energy loss to the biotic community and is equivalent to the oxidation of 26 g C{\textperiodcentered} m-2• year-I.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses are often used to quantify the contribution of multiple sources to a mixture, such as proportions of food sources in an animal's diet, or C 3 and C 4 plant inputs to soil organic carbon. Linear mixing models can be used to partition two sources with a single isotopic signature (e.g., {\&}{\#}39 13 C) or three sources with a second isotopic signature (e.g., {\&}{\#}39 15 N). Although variability of source and mixture signatures is often reported, confidence interval calculations for source proportions typically use only the mixture variability. We provide examples showing that omission of source variability can lead to underestimation of the variability of source proportion estimates. For both two- and three-source mixing models, we present formulas for calculating variances, standard errors (SE), and confidence intervals for source proportion estimates that account for the observed variability in the isotopic signatures for the sources as well as the mixture. We then performed sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance of: (1) the isotopic signature difference between the sources, (2) isotopic signature standard deviations (SD) in the source and mixture populations, (3) sample size, (4) analytical SD, and (5) the evenness of the source proportions, for determining the variability (SE) of source proportion estimates. The proportion SEs varied inversely with the signature difference between sources, so doubling the source difference from 2{\&}{\#}137; to 4{\&}{\#}137; reduced the SEs by half. Source and mixture signature SDs had a substantial linear effect on source proportion SEs. However, the population variability of the sources and the mixture are fixed and the sampling error component can be changed only by increasing sample size. Source proportion SEs varied inversely with the square root of sample size, so an increase from 1 to 4 samples per population cut the SE in half. Analytical SD had little effect over the range examined since it was generally substantially smaller than the population SDs. Proportion SEs were minimized when sources were evenly divided, but increased only slightly as the proportions varied. The variance formulas provided will enable quantification of the precision of source proportion estimates. Graphs are provided to allow rapid assessment of possible combinations of source differences and source and mixture population SDs that will allow source proportion estimates with desired precision. In addition, an Excel spreadsheet to perform the calculations for the source proportions and their variances, SEs, and 95{\%} confidence intervals for the two-source and three-source mixing models can be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of carbon isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant carbon isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the whole body of an animal reflects the isotopic composition of its diet, but the animal is on average enriched in [delta]13C by about 1[per mille sign] relative to the diet. In three of the four cases examined, the 13C enrichment of the whole body relative to the diet is balanced by a 13C depletion of the respired CO2. The isotopic relationships between the whole bodies of animals and their diets are similar for different species raised on the same diet and for the same species raised on different diets. However, the [delta]13C values of whole bodies of individuals of a species raised on the same diet may differ by up to 2[per mille sign]. The relationship between the 13C/12C ratio of a tissue and the 13C/12C ratio of the diet depends both on the type of tissue and on the nature of the diet. Many of the isotopic relationships among the major biochemical fractions, namely the lipid, carbohydrate and protein fractions, are qualitatively preserved as diet carbon is incorporated into the animal. However, the difference between the [delta]13C values of a biochemical fraction in an animal and in its diet may be as large as 3[per mille sign]. The [delta]13C values of the biochemical components collagen, chitin and the insoluble organic fraction of shells, all of which are often preserved in fossil material, are related to the isotopic composition of the diet. These results indicate that it will be possible to perform dietary analysis based on the determination of the 13C/12C ratio of animal carbon. Analysis of the total animal carbon will in most cases provide a better measure of diet than the analysis of individual tissues, biochemical fractions, or biochemical components. The limits of accuracy of this method will generally restrict its application to situations in which the diet is derived from sources with relatively large differences in their [delta]13C values, such as terrestrial vs aquatic organisms or C3 vs C4 plants. The method should be applicable to fossil as well as to living material.},

We conducted a broad-scale analysis of $\Delta$$\delta$15N and $\Delta$$\delta$13C from aquatic systems, including three new field estimates. Carnivores had significantly higher $\Delta$$\delta$15N values than herbivores. Furthermore, carnivores, invertebrates, and lab-derived estimates were significantly more variable than their counterparts ( f-test, p {\textless} 0.00001). $\Delta$$\delta$13C was higher for carnivores than for herbivores (p = 0.001), while variances did not differ significantly. Excluding herbivores, the average $\Delta$$\delta$15N and $\Delta$$\delta$13C were 3.4‰ and 0.8‰, respectively. But even with unbiased fractionation estimates, there is variation in isotopic fractionation that contributes to error in quantitative isotope model outputs. We simulated the error variance in $\delta$15N-based estimates of trophic position and two-source $\delta$13C diet mixing models, explicitly considering the observed variation in $\Delta$$\delta$15N and $\Delta$$\delta$13C, along with the other potential error sources. The resultant error in trophic position and mixing model outputs was generally minor, provided that primary consumers were used as baseline indicators for estimating trophic position and that end member d13C values in dietary mixing models were sufficiently distinct.},

The simulations consider the impact of measurement error and process error in catchability and the length at 50{\%} selectivity, as well as the implications of pooling data across populations that differ in terms of growth rate. The ability to estimate the virgin biomass depends critically on having catch-rate or size-composition data for earliest years of exploitation; in the absence of such data the estimates can be highly biased and imprecise. Several of the reference points commonly reported for assessment purposes (e.g. the biomass at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved) are, however, based on the estimate of the virgin biomass. Estimation performance (bias and precision of estimated quantities) deteriorates with increasing process error. For most of the scenarios examined, the expected benefits of increased precision arising from pooling data across spatial zones are not realized and better performance can be achieved by conducting assessments at the level of population and subsequently aggregating results spatially. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A jackknife resampling was then used to reduce bias of the predictions and estimate their uncertainty. The method is easy to programme, "data driven", and fully automated. It provides a realistic estimate of uncertainty for each predicted location, and could be readily extended to 3-dimentional cases. For SIC97 purposes, the IDW was set to be an exact interpolator (smoothing parameter was set to zero), with the search radius set at the maximum extend of data. Other parameters were optimized as follows: exponent = 4, anisotropy ratio = 4.5 and anisotropy angle = 40°. The results predicted by the IDW interpolator were later compared with the actual values measured at the same locations. The overall root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between predicted and observed rainfall for all 367 unknown locations was 6.32 mm of rain. The method was successful in predicting 50{\%} and 65{\%} of the exact locations of the twenty highest and lowest measurements respectively. Of the measured values, 65{\%} (238 out of 367 data points) fell within jackknife-predicted 95{\%} confidence intervals, uniquely constructed for each predicted location.},

In turn, larval recruitment is determined using various indicators of planktonic larval abundance (larval supply). Based on plankton and settlement data collected over an entire settlement period of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, we explore the variability in the strength of the relationships between the abundance of newly settled individuals sampled daily at 3 shore levels and the daily larval abundance at 3 different depths over a 10 d study period. The best correlation was obtained between the number of larvae collected near the bottom and the number of spat sampled in the low intertidal. More than 75{\%} of the variability in the abundance of newly settled spat in the lower intertidal was explained by variations in the larval abundance near the bottom. Larval abundance integrated over the entire water column explained similar to 50{\%} of the variability in low shore settlement, but failed to be significant. All other comparisons showed a lack of correlations. Our approach demonstrates that indicators of larval supply must be carefully and solidly documented to reflect the relationships between abundance of competent larvae, settlement intensity, and subsequently recruitment.},

Can multiplicative kernel smoothers be used for this purpose? What advantages does this approach have over more traditional habitat modelling methods? Methods: Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was developed from the premises that: the response variable has a minimum of zero and a physiologically-determined maximum, species respond simultaneously to multiple eco- logical factors, the response to any one factor is conditioned by the values of other factors, and that if any of the factors is intolerable then the response is zero. Key features of NPMR are interactive effects of predictors, no need to specify an overall model form in advance, and built-in controls on overfitting. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with simulated and real data sets. Results: Empirical and theoretical relationships of species response to multiple interacting predictors can be represented effectively by multiplicative kernel smoothers. NPMR allows us to abandon simplistic assumptions about overall model form, while embracing the ecological truism that habitat fac- tors interact.},

Especially, the often-dominant crustaceans could be negatively affected because cyanobacteria are deficient in phytosterols, which are required by the crustaceans to form the membrane component cholesterol, which in turn plays a role in thermal adaptation. Here, we determined the influence of temperature on growth, reproduction and the allocation of dietary sterol into somatic tissues and eggs of the keystone species Daphnia magna raised along a dietary cholesterol gradient. Mass-specific growth rates of D. magna increased with the increasing availability of dietary cholesterol up to an incipient limiting level, which increased with increasing temperature. This indicates a higher demand for cholesterol for growth at higher temperatures and may explain the consistently smaller clutch sizes of reproducing females at the highest temperature. The cholesterol content of the individuals increased with increasing dietary cholesterol; this increase was enhanced at higher temperatures, indicating a high er demand for cholesterol for tissues and probably specifically for membranes. Surprisingly, the daphnids showed different allocation strategies with regard to temperature and dietary sterol availability. The cholesterol content of eggs was enhanced at higher temperature, which suggested that females allocate more cholesterol to their offspring, presumably to ensure sufficient egg development. When dietary cholesterol was limiting, however, females did not allocate more cholesterol to their eggs. Our data suggest that during cyanobacterial blooms, a potential dietary sterol limitation of Daphnia can be intensified at higher water temperatures, which can occur with global warming},

abstract = {Fluvial bed sediments represent an important sink and source for a variety of organic and inorganic compounds. Their most important constituent is organic matter (OM) and its primary component organic carbon (OC). Few studies have been conducted in fluvial environments examining bed-associated OM or OC. This is surprising given the recent interest in global carbon cycling and the importance of bed-associated organics as ecosystem energy sources. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between OM, determined by loss-on-ignition (LOI), and OC in fluvial bed sediments determined by a dry combustion analyzer. The wide adoption of the LOI method in soil science reflects its ease of use, it is inexpensive, it is rapid, requires no specialized training, and strong statistical relationships commonly exist between OM and OC estimated by standard dry combustion procedures. Regression modelswere developed betweenOC andOMfor six bed sediment size fractions (2.0 mm) for 113 sample sites in a tropical stream on Oahu, Hawaii. All models were highly significant (p {\textless} 0.0001), with coefficients of determination ranging from 35 to 79{\%}. Measurement of LOI explained 64{\%} of the variation in OC for all grouped data. The black-box LOI approach may be useful for rapid reconnaissance surveys of drainage systems. Examination of OM to OC conversion factors for Manoa bed sediments indicates that values typically observed in the soils literature (1.7–2.2) are far too low. Values of OM/OC were found to increase with increasing grain size, and decrease with increasing LOI percentage. Conversion factors obtained for grouped data had a mean of 14.9, a coefficient of variation of 21{\%}, and a range of values between 6.2 and 27.4. It is suggested that these high conversion factors reflect significant water loss by dehydration of Fe, Al, and Mn oxides at a muffle furnace temperature of 450 C. Therefore, the blind application of conversion factors developed from soils should be avoided when converting from OM to OC for fluvial bed sediments.},

abstract = {We discuss methodological aspects directed to quantify the across-shore population structure and abundance of sandy beach macroinfauna. The reliability of estimates derived from design-based (stratified random sampling) and model-based (geostatistics, kriging) approaches is discussed. Our analysis also addresses potential biases arising from environmentally driven designs that consider a priori fixed strata for sampling macroinfauna, as opposed to species-driven sampling designs, in which the entire range of across-shore distribution is covered. Model-based approaches showed, spatially, highly autocorrelated and persistent structures in two intertidal populations of the Uruguayan coast: the isopod Excirolana armata and the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides. Both populations presented zonation patterns that ranged from the base of the dunes to upper levels of the subtidal. The Gaussian model consistently explained the spatial distribution of species and population components (clam recruits and adults), with a minor contribution (less than or equal to 5{\%}) of unresolved, small-scale variability. The consistent structure of spatial dependence in annual data strongly suggests an across-shore-structured process covering close to 35 in. Kriging predictions through cross-validation corroborated the appropriateness of the models fitted through vario-graphic analysis, and the derived abundance estimates were very similar (maximum difference 7{\%}) to those obtained from linear interpolation. Monthly analysis of E. armata data showed marked variations in its zonation and an unstable spatial structure according to the Gaussian model. The clear spatial structure resulting from species-driven sampling was not observed when data was truncated to simulate an environmentally driven sampling design. In this case, the linear semi-variogram indicated a spatial gradient, suggesting that sampling was not performed at the appropriate spatial scale. Further, the cross-validation procedure was not significant, and both density and total abundance were underestimated. We conclude that: (1) geostatistics provides useful additional information about population structure and aids in direct abundance estimation; thus we suggest it as a powerful tool for further applications in the study of sandy beach macroinfauna; and that (2) environmentally driven sampling strategies fail to provide conclusive results about population structure and abundance, and should be avoided in studies of sandy beach populations. This is especially true for microtidal beaches, where unpredictable swash strength precludes a priori stratification through environmental reference points. The need to use adaptive sampling designs and avoid snapshot sampling is also stressed. Methodological implications for the detection of macroecological patterns in sandy beach macroinfauna are also discussed.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

Therefore, although these species rely on different sources of food, large animals of M. balthica can overlap the trophic niche of C. edule.

abstract = {Ecologists carry a well-stocked toolbox with a great variety of sampling methods, statistical analyses and modelling tools, and new methods are constantly appearing. Evaluation and optimisation of these methods is crucial to guide methodological choices. Simulating error-free data or taking high-quality data to qualify methods is common practice. Here, we emphasise the methodology of the 'virtual ecologist' (VE) approach where simulated data and observer models are used to mimic real species and how they are 'virtually' observed. This virtual data is then subjected to statistical analyses and modelling, and the results are evaluated against the 'true' simulated data. The VE approach is an intuitive and powerful evaluation framework that allows a quality assessment of sampling protocols, analyses and modelling tools. It works under controlled conditions as well as under consideration of confounding factors such as animal movement and biased observer behaviour. In this review, we promote the approach as a rigorous research tool, and demonstrate its capabilities and practical relevance. We explore past uses of VE in different ecological research fields, where it mainly has been used to test and improve sampling regimes as well as for testing and comparing models, for example species distribution models. We discuss its benefits as well as potential limitations, and provide some practical considerations for designing VE studies. Finally, research fields are identified for which the approach could be useful in the future. We conclude that VE could foster the integration of theoretical and empirical work and stimulate work that goes far beyond sampling methods, leading to new questions, theories, and better mechanistic understanding of ecological systems.},

abstract = {Simulation models are useful and flexible tools that can be used to synthesize information gained from multiple stock identification methods. The assimilation of information from many sources into a population dynamics model can provide a holistic view of stock structure. Application of spatially explicit models within the simulation framework allows the testing of varying hypotheses regarding stock structure and connectivity. Additionally, using this approach we can examine the ecological, assessment, and management implications of complex spatial structure for the fish resource. This chapter summarizes the simulation modeling framework and how it can be applied to investigate population structure. We highlight how stock identification data can be incorporated into simulations and review recent advances in spatial modeling techniques. We conclude with a discussion of seminal case studies, which illustrate how simulation models have impacted our understanding of stock structure in fish populations. Ultimately, simulation models have many limitations because they are simplified abstractions of large and complex natural systems. However, when carefully vetted and used with strict adherence to the scientific method, simulations can be powerful and invaluable tools for examining spatial population structure. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the Strait of Georgia and Howe Sound, British Columbia, colonies of individual cloud sponges, growing on rock (known as sponge gardens) receive resource subsidies from the high biodiversity of epifauna on adjacent rock habitats. Bioherms are reefs of glass sponges living on layers of dead sponges. In the same area as the sponge gardens, newly discovered bioherms in Howe Sound, BC (49.34.67 N, 123.16.26W) at depths of 28- to 35-m are constructed exclusively by Aphrocallistes vastus, the cloud sponge. The sponge gardens had much higher taxon rich- ness than the bioherms. The sponge garden had 106 species from 10 phyla, whereas the bioherm had only 15 species from 5 phyla. For recruiting juvenile rockWsh (quillback, Sebastes maliger), the food subsidy of sponge gardens appears to be missing on bioherms of cloud sponge, where biodiversity is relatively low. While adult and subadult rockWshes (S. maliger, S. ruberrimus, S. proriger, and S. elongatus) were present on bioherms, no evidence for nursery recruitment of inshore rockWshes to bioherms was observed, whereas the sponge gardens supported high den- sities of newly recruited S. maliger, perhaps owing to the combination of both refuge and feeding opportunities. These results indicate that sponge gardens form a habitat for early stages of inshore S. maliger, whereas A. vastus bioherms are associated only with older juvenile and adult rockWshes.},

Based on the information about small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) off the coast of China, we simulated a fish population consisting of three subpopulations mixing at intermediate levels, which was considered in the true spatial structure of the population in this study. Three scenarios of population spatial structure were assumed in assessing and managing this simulated fishery: (i) metapopulation, which has the same structure as the true population; (ii) three independent subpopulations, which overlook the exchanges among the subpopulations; and (iii) unit population, which completely ignores the population spatial structure. Corresponding approaches were applied to assess and manage each of these assumed fish populations. The management time period was assumed to be 10 years with two harvesting levels (i.e., maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and f0.1). Assessing and managing the metapopulation as several independent populations could lead to a high probability of overexploitation. Managing the metapopulation as a unit population could lead to local depletion. Use of MSY as a management target may be risk prone in the existence of a metapopulation, and use of a fishing mortality lower than f0.1 as a management target is more desirable.},

abstract = {Primary productivity by plants and algae is the fundamental source of energy in virtually all food webs. Furthermore, photosynthetic organisms are the sole source for $\omega$-3 and $\omega$-6 essential fatty acids (EFA) to upper trophic levels. Because animals cannot synthesize EFA, these molecules may be useful as trophic markers for tracking sources of primary production through food webs if different primary producer groups have different EFA signatures. We tested the hypothesis that different marine macrophyte groups have distinct fatty acid (FA) signatures by conducting a phylogenetic survey of 40 marine macrophytes (seaweeds and seagrasses) representing 36 families, 21 orders, and four phyla in the San Juan Archipelago, WA, USA. We used multivariate statistics to show that FA composition differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) among phyla, orders, and families using 44 FA and a subset of seven EFA (P {\textless} 0.001). A second analysis of published EFA data of 123 additional macrophytes confirmed that this pattern was robust on a global scale (P {\textless} 0.001). This phylogenetic differentiation of macrophyte taxa shows a clear relationship between macrophyte phylogeny and FA content and strongly suggests that FA signature analyses can offer a viable approach to clarifying fundamental questions about the contribution of different basal resources to food webs. Moreover, these results imply that taxa with commercially valuable EFA signatures will likely share such characteristics with other closely related taxa that have not yet been evaluated for FA content.},

abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The ecosystem engineering concept focuses on how organisms physically change the abiotic environment and how this feeds back to the biota. While the concept was formally introduced a little more than 10 years ago, the underpinning of the concept can be traced back to more than a century to the early work of Darwin. The formal application of the idea is yielding new insights into the role of species in ecosystems and many other areas of basic and applied ecology. Here we focus on how temporal, spatial and organizational scales usefully inform the roles played by ecosystem engineers and their incorporation into broader ecological contexts. Two particular, distinguishing features of ecosystem engineers are that they affect the physical space in which other species live and their direct effects can last longer than the lifetime of the organism--engineering can in essence outlive the engineer. Together, these factors identify critical considerations that need to be included in models, experimental and observational work. The ecosystem engineering concept holds particular promise in the area of ecological applications, where influence over abiotic variables and their consequent effects on biotic communities may facilitate ecological restoration and counterbalance anthropogenic influences.},

abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17{\%} and 33{\%}, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the "rebuilding quotas") in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.},

abstract = {We capitalized on a long-term record of larval recruitment and a distinctive oceanographic signature to reveal how changes in ocean conditions affect larval advection, behavior, and recruitment in a region of strong, persistent upwelling and recruitment limitation. We repeatedly sampled the vertical and horizontal distribution of a larval assemblage and ocean conditions during infrequent relaxations of prevailing upwelling winds near Bodega Bay, California. During prolonged relaxation events, a poleward, coastal, boundary current imported low-salinity surface waters that were devoid of larvae to the study area. The resident larval assemblage was restricted to cold, saline, bottom waters and pushed offshore while diel vertical migrations were suppressed. Hence, changes in oceanographic conditions strongly affected behaviorally mediated larval distributions, revealing the reason that few species recruit during relaxation events in this region. During relaxation events in upwelling regions, poleward coastal boundary currents will force larvae offshore throughout the water column at small headlands and in seaward-flowing bottom currents at straight coastlines, but recruitment may decrease markedly only near estuaries where few larvae will arrive in low-salinity surface waters. Targeted profiling of larval assemblages complements widespread monitoring of recruitment from shore and is necessary to determine how changing ocean conditions affect larval distributions, recruitment dynamics, and the connectivity of populations.},

abstract = {The species composition and dynamics of phytoplankton in the water column and its contribution to clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, and oyster, Crassostrea gigas, production were studied in the Akkeshi-ko estuary, eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan. A total 128 taxa of diatoms were identified, with 103 and 102 species occurring on the surface sediments and in the water column, respectively. Amphora sp., Bacillaria paradoxa var paxilifer, Cocconeis scutellum, Navicula sp., Nitzschia sigma, Paralia sulcata, Rhoicosphenia curvata, Synedra ulna and Thalassiosira sp. were most common and dominant in all stations in both water column and surface sediment. Benthic diatoms were most dominant in both water column and surface sediment. The species composition of epiphytes was, in part, similar to diatom assemblage of the water column and also to that of the surface sediment. The benthic and pelagic ratio in the diatom assemblage of the water column was very high. Benthic diatoms were able to resuspend into water column by turbulence stimulated by wind. Chlorophyll a concentration in the water column increased as wind speed increased. Seventy and 67{\%} of the gut contents oysters consisted of benthic diatoms in 2003 and 2004 and also 78 and 87{\%} of clams in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The availability of benthic and epiphytic diatom assemblages contributes significantly to food resources for clam and oyster mariculture due to resuspension by disturbance in the Akkeshi-ko estuary.},

abstract = {Microbial activity and accumulation of organic matter in the burrow of the thalassinidean mud shrimp, Upogebia major, were studied on a tidal Xat along the northern coast of Tokyo Bay, Japan. The burrow of U. major is Y-shaped with an upper U-shaped part plus a lower I-shaped part. Its lower part can extend to a depth of 2 m. In the present study, we compare electron transport system activity (ETSA), bacterial abundance and organic matter content [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and chlorophyll a (chl. a)] of the burrow wall sediment with the tidal Xat surface and non-burrow sediments. We also compared the U- and I-shaped part in terms of these parameters. ETSA in the burrow wall was higher than at the tidal Xat surface in the warmer season, and was always higher than at surrounding non-burrow sediments. Bacterial abundance in the burrow wall was higher than at the tidal Xat surface and surrounding sediment. TOC and TN contents in the burrow wall were two to three times higher than those at the tidal Xat surface and non-burrow sediments, regardless of season. However, there was no signiWcant diVerence in chl. a content between burrow wall and tidal Xat surface. These results suggest that organic enrichment of the burrow wall is a result of organic matter particles such as phytodebris accumulation along the burrow wall. For all parameters of the burrow walls, no statistical diVerences were found between the two parts. Present results indicate that U. major actively transports the water containing suspended organic particles not only through the U-part but also into the deeper I-part. These indicate that burrow of the mud shrimp provides a dynamic environment for microbial community in tidal Xat sediment.},

abstract = {The current study examined the direct interactions between intertidal seagrasses (Zosteraceae) and burrowing ghost shrimps (Callianassidae) and their influence on associated infaunal assemblages. Reciprocal transplant experiments conducted in two temperate regions revealed different interactions between both types of organism. In the U.S.A., seagrass prospered in all treatments, irrespective of the presence of ghost shrimp, whilst ghost shrimp declined in plots containing seagrass. In New Zealand, neither transplanted ghost shrimp nor seagrass became established in experimental plots, at the same time, neither type of organism appeared to be affected by the experimental addition of transplants. The differences in interactions between seagrass and ghost shrimp appeared to be related to seasonal differences in the timing of the transplant experiments and the pairing of particular ghost shrimp and seagrass species in each region. Infaunal assemblages showed distinct differences between seagrass and ghost shrimp treatments and reflected the dominant type of organism present. In treatments where transplanted seagrass or ghost shrimp became established, assemblage composition shifted in accordance with the type of transplanted organism. Differences in assemblage composition were characterised by higher relative abundances of discriminating taxa in treatments dominated by seagrass. The overall patterns of infaunal assemblage composition were correlated with a number of variables including the number of shoots, above-, below-ground seagrass biomass, {\%} fines/sand, {\%} total organic carbon, and sediment chlorophyll a. Findings from this study highlight the functional importance of intertidal seagrasses and burrowing ghost shrimps and reveal some of the ecological repercussions associated with changes in the distribution of these sympatric ecosystem engineers. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We developed an operating model to simulate a fishery using US Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as our model species. This population consists of two well-defined spawning substocks distributed and mixed in four management areas. Simulations were done for three alternative “true” populations, each having a different spatial structure both biologically and with regard to the geographic distribution of fishing effort.

The species is intensively exploited in the area as live bait for hand lines and long lines both for professional and sport fishermen. The study area is a closed bay in western Greece with a small opening which connects it to the Ionian Sea. Longevity of the species in the study area was found to be 4+ years. Females' total length ranged between 18 and 54 mm; for males it ranged between 16 and 58 mm. The von Bertalanffy parameters for males were L∞=60.30 mm, K=0.520 per year and t0=-0.0166 years; for females they were L∞=58.80 mm, K=0.621 per year and t0=- 0.1261 years. Overall von Bertalanffy equation parameters were L∞=61.05 mm, K=0.521 per year and t0=0.086 years. Maximum weight was estimated as 3.440 g at L∞ based on the length-weight relationship. Mortality estimates were Z=1.510 per year, M=0.928 per year and F=0.582 per year resulting in an exploitation ratio of E=39{\%}. Using the above values, yield per recruit was estimated at 2.97 g/year at Fmax levels of 0.750 per year and Eopt=50{\%}.

Food sources of animals were assessed based on the diet – tissue isotopic fractionation ($\delta$13C = 0.6 to 2.0‰, $\delta$15N = 3.4 to 3.9‰) of 3 main constituent species (the bivalves Mactra veneriformis and Ruditapes philippi- narum and the ghost shrimp Nihonotrypaea japonica), which had been determined by an earlier laboratory experiment. The results revealed that (1) consumers were classified into 3 groups; a group consisting of 51 species including 4 main species (the above-mentioned species and the mud shrimp Upogebia major) that derived nutrition mainly from coastal phytoplankton, one consisting of 7 species that incorporated more 13C-enriched material (e.g. benthic microalgae) and a group con- sisting of 4 species that incorporated more 13C-reduced material (e.g. riverine organic matter); (2) the phytoplankton-based trophic structure was composed of 3 trophic levels; (3) M. veneriformis juve- niles collected during the rainy season appeared to incorporate riverine organic matter; and (4) reeds from the flood plain, detrital terrestrial plant material, sewage effluents and seaweeds were not food sources for most consumers. We concluded that the high phytoplankton biomass and scarcity of benthic microalgae on this sandflat account for its phytoplankton-based trophic structure.},

abstract = {Sedimentary habitats are complex associations of biotic, chemical, and physical pro- cesses comprising ‘ecosystem function'. The relative importance of these processes to biogeochemi- cal cycling in highly reactive, permeable sediments remains poorly understood. We report results from several field experiments in a muddy-sand intertidal flat dominated by 2 functionally different types of bioturbating macrofauna in False Bay, Washington, USA: (1) the arenicolid polychaete Abarenicola pacifica and (2) 2 species of thalassinid shrimp (Upogebia pugettensis and Neotrypaea californiensis). Experimental plots composed primarily of one of the study taxa or mixed communities of both were evaluated for their effects on porewater advection, solute concentrations, and sediment characteristics. Fluorescein-impregnated acrylamide gels were used to infer rates of transport, and acrylamide gel peepers were used to record porewater concentrations of diagenetically important constituents among experimental plots. Laboratory studies evaluated rates of diffusive transport in non-bioturbated sediments for comparative analysis. We found that (1) functionally different macro- fauna affect rates of porewater advection in permeable sediments, (2) organism effects are not attrib- utable to changes in average measures of sediment granulometry, (3) species interactions may further complicate the advective environment and the resulting diagenetic processes, and (4) species effects vary according to reaction rate kinetics. We hypothesize that species-related effects on trans- port are due to inhibition of arenicolid feeding by thalassinid tubes that serve to block sediment fluidization and advective flow. Thus, specific behaviors and interactions among organisms appear to affect transport rates and sediment function in advectively permeable habitats. The results indicate the importance of integrating behavior, kinetics, and transport into future studies of sedimentary biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

To test this model, we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these processes at 16–44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon, California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or downwelling during spring–summer. As predicted by the IUH, ecological subsidies (phytoplankton abundance, prey recruitment rates), prey responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with upwelling magnitude explained ∼50{\%} of the variance in the various processes, and unimodal and monotonic positive relationships agains...},

Climate change may result in sea level rise; water temperature increase; and deviations from present patterns of precipitation, wind, and water circulation. Estuaries may experience loss of marsh habitat, intrusion of marine waters and associated organisms, changes in circulation patterns that affect retention of some indigenous species, and increased hypoxia and storm surges. Estuarine and coastal systems could experience poleward retreat of cold-tolerant species and range expansion of warm-tolerant species. Some fisheries and aquacultural enterprises and communities would benefit from the results of climate change and others would suffer losses, with economic and population dislocations probably inevitable in many parts of the world. Thus, flexibility in policy-making and planning will be vital if global climate is modified as rapidly as is anticipated by some scientists.},

abstract = {Food webs are complex systems of interactions between ecosystem species. Beyond the direct analysis of stomach contents, stable isotopes of carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) have been used widely to evaluate these trophic relationships and calculate the relative contribution of food sources to a consumer's diet using mixing models. However, there are still some constraints on the use of these traditional tracers that limit their output. Here, we briefly comment on the potential of using multiple tracers (i.e., stable isotopes of C, N and H; trace metals), and applying recent numerical approaches (i.e. Bayesian mixing models) to advance the understanding of complex aquatic food webs. Stable isotopes of hydrogen ($\delta$ 2H), normally used to examine large-scale migration patterns of terrestrial animals, have been recently proposed as a complementary trophic tracer in aquatic ecosystems. The principle for this application is the large isotopic difference in $\delta$2H among food items that can be found in some aquatic systems. Other potential trophic indicators are such substances that accumulate through diet (e.g., trace metals). These substances are traditionally studied from bioaccumulation or toxicological perspectives, but there are indications that encourage their use for tracing food web interactions. Bayesian mixing models, which are able to incorporate several sources of variability and multiple food sources in the model, can help to solve puzzling results. In summary, we suggest that the simultaneous use of multiple tracers will provide more reliable results than any of them in isolation. The challenge is to develop methods to combine them enhancing their strengths and minimizing uncertainty. {\textcopyright} Asociaci{\'{o}}n Ib{\'{e}}rica de Limnolog{\'{i}}a, Madrid. Spain.},

abstract = {Abstract: Growth rate in ectotherms, including most fish, is a function of temperature. For decades, agriculturalists (270+ years) and entomologists (45+ years) have recognized the thermal integral, known as the growing degree-day (GDD, °C{\textperiodcentered}day), to be a reliable predictor of growth and development. Fish and fisheries researchers have yet to widely acknowledge the power of the GDD in explaining growth and development among fishes. We demonstrate that fish length-at-day (LaD), in most cases prior to maturation, is a strong linear function of the GDD metric that can explain {\textgreater}92{\%} of the variation in LaD among 41 data sets representing nine fish species drawn from marine and freshwater en- vironments, temperate and tropical climes, constant and variable temperature regimes, and laboratory and field studies. The GDD demonstrates explanatory power across large spatial scales, e.g., 93{\%} of the variation in LaD for age-2 to -4 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across their entire range (17 stocks) is explained by one simple GDD function. Moreover, GDD can explain much of the variation in fish egg development time and in aquatic invertebrate (crab) size-at-age. Our analysis extends the well-established and physiologically relevant GDD metric to fish where, relative to conven- tional time-based methods, it provides greater explanatory power.

abstract = {1. Growth of the body length in vertebrates is well known to be unidirectional, with organisms progressively increasing in body size as they become older. However, there is evidence that body length shrinkage is a survival strategy for some vertebrates under unfavourable environmental conditions. Here we report both experimental and field evidence that the body length of young stream-dwelling salmonids can decrease in winter. 2. In examining how juvenile salmonid fish responded to harsh environmental conditions, we were faced with unexpected and previously undocumented observations in terms of growth performance, indicating that fish do shrink in harsh winter conditions. Young salmonids showed significant shrinking of individual body length, up to 10{\%} of the body length, over the course of winter. The dynamics of the growth in length of these fish can be explained by a combination of anorectic stress and environmental conditions. Under stable, sheltered underwater conditions fish were best able to maintain positive growth in length. 3. We propose that growth in body length of a vertebrate animal can be temporally negative, individuals suffering from nutritional deficits shrinking in their length in addition to losing their body mass. There is circumstantial evidence that subsequent compensatory growth can have unexpected and dramatic longer-term costs. Experimental approaches, both field- and laboratory based, are sorely needed to reveal how common a phenomenon negative structural growth is among animals, and what the consequences are for individual performance, and, furthermore, for population dynamics.},

abstract = {The fatty acid content of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba from South Georgia was investigated during January and February 1996, a period of relatively low algal biomass. Cluster analysis of the fatty acid data revealed 3 regionally distinct groups of krill. Group A consisted primarily of subadults (median length 42 mm) and was characterised by high proportions of 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9) fatty acids. Group B comprised mainly juveniles and a small proportion of adults (median length 33 mm) and had a fatty acid profile similar to that of Group A. The largest group, Group C (8 of 14 stations, mostly to the east of the survey area), was almost exclusively juveniles plus a small number of sub-adults (median length 29 mm) and had unusually high percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA; 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3)]. Krill from Group C had the lowest total fatty acid concentrations (150 to 722 mg/kg). These krill were surviving on the lowest algal biomass in the region and had probably resorted to carnivory on PUFA rich copepods. The pattern of fatty acids in krill from Groups A and B resembled that of krill collected from a diatom bloom in the Bellingshausen Sea, but the concentrations were generally lower. The well fed krill from the Bellingshausen Sea showed small variations in fatty acid content associated with sex and maturity, but the South Georgia results indicated that diet can have a greater impact on fatty acid content than sex and maturity stages. Fatty acid profiles were indicative of food regimes that were so distinct that the krill probably originated from spatially independent groups.},

abstract = {Environmental changes are expected to alter both the distribution and the abundance of organisms. A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Considering the relative significance of different dispersal rates and strategies is key for a better understanding of the scale and potential thresholds of benthic recovery processes. Despite our increased understanding of post-larval dispersal in tidal areas, our knowledge of post-larval dispersal potential is very limited for non-tidal systems, for example in the Baltic Sea, where dispersal has not previously been quantified in soft-sediment communities. For non-tidal systems the absence of regular tidal-mediated currents would suggest that post-larval dispersal potential might be limited. In this study a combination of traps was used to quantify post-larval dispersal across a wind exposure gradient in a non-tidal system. Traps allowed for a comparison of species either emerging from the sediment, being transported in sediment bedload, being transported in the water column or settling from the water column. Results from this study provide the first evidence that also in the Baltic Sea, a non-tidal system, benthic species disperse in relative proportions distinctly different from the relative composition of the resident community. A variety of post-larval dispersal strategies with species-specific differences were observed. Dispersal in the water-column might be comparatively less important in the Baltic Sea where tidal currents are absent. The majority of epifaunal species represented in the ambient community were also recorded within all dispersal modes, whereas infaunal species were less common. This suggests that, in the absence of regular tides, infaunal dispersal may be more stochastic and dependent on wind-induced waves and currents exceeding a long-term average. Post-larval dispersal was also found to be modified by the local hydrodynamic regime. Our results highlight the importance of different post-larval dispersal strategies for connectivity in soft-sediment communities in non-tidal systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cellular degradative processes, which include lysosomal (autophagic) and proteasomal degradation, as well as catabolism of proteins by cytosolic and mitochondrial proteases, provide for a continuous turnover of cellular components, such as damaged or obsolete biomolecules and organelles. Inherent insufficiency of these degradative processes results in progressive accumulation within long-lived postmitotic cells of biological 'garbage' (waste material), such as various oxidized proteins, functionally effete mitochondria, and lipofuscin (age pigment), an intralysosomal, polymeric, undegradable material. There is increasing evidence that lipofuscin hampers lysosomal degradative capacity, thus promoting the aggravation of accumulated damage at old age. Being rich in redox-active iron, lipofuscin granules also may exacerbate oxidative stress levels in senescent cells. Thus, increasing the efficiency of cellular degradative pathways and preventing involvement of iron in oxidant-induced lysosomal and cellular damage may be potential strategies for anti-aging interventions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible explanations for the patterns in autotroph abundances were exploredthrough examination of their correlations with the physicochemical characteristics of the water column. Studysites were established in each of three zones in the estuary defined by temperature and salinity and were sampled monthlyJune through September 1998 and in July 1999. Z. marina and macroalgal cover and Z. marina shoot density weremeasured in 0.25-m2 plots at each site. After cover estimates and shoot counts were made, material was harvested fordetermination of Z. marina and macroalgal biomass. Water column variables were measured from stations near eachstudy site and composited on a depth-averaged, monthly basis for each zone. Both Z. marina and green macroalgalabundance differed between sites, over the summer in 1998, and between years. Seasonal patterns were most obviousfor Z. marina at the site closest to the ocean while the pattern in macroalgal abundance suggested a bloom moving upriver as summer progressed. The physicochemical characteristics of the zones differed with the season and could berelated to the patterns in Z. marina and macroalgal abundance. In particular, salinity was positively correlated with Z.marina abundance, while abundance of both autotrophs was related to light availability. Z. marina biomass ranged 19--109 g dry weight m22; green macroalgae biomass ranged 5--234 g dry weight m22. The biomass of the green macroalgaeat several sites and dates equaled or exceed that of the Z. marina suggesting the potential for nuisance algal bloomsdoes exist in Yaquina Bay.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses are increasingly employed to characterise population niche widths. The convex hull area (TA) in a $\delta$(13)C-$\delta$(15)N biplot has been used as a measure of isotopic niche width, but concerns exist over its dependence on sample size and associated difficulties in among-population comparisons. Recently a more robust method was proposed for estimating and comparing isotopic niche widths using standard ellipse areas (SEA), but this approach has yet to be tested with empirical stable isotope data. The two methods measure different kind of isotopic niche areas, but both are now widely used to characterise isotopic niche widths of populations. We used simulated data and an extensive empirical dataset from two fish populations to test the influence of sample size on the observed isotopic niche widths (TA and SEA). We resampled the original datasets to generate 5000 new samples for different numbers of observations from 5 to 80 to examine the statistical distributions of niche area estimates for increasing sample size. Our results illustrate how increasing sample size increased the observed TA; even sample sizes much higher than n = 30 did not improve the precision for the TA method. SEA was less sensitive to sample size, but the natural variation in our empirical fish $\delta$(13)C and $\delta$(15)N data still resulted in considerable uncertainty around the mean estimates of niche width, reducing the precision particularly with sample sizes n{\textless}30. These results confirm that the TA method is less appropriate for estimating population isotopic niche areas using small samples, especially when considerable population level isotope variation is expected. The results also indicate a need for caution when using SEA as a measure of trophic niche widths for consumers, particularly with low sample sizes and when the distribution and range for population isotope values are not known.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Settlement and recruitment of benthic marine invertebrates are complex processes, deter- mined by the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors which operate at different temporal and spatial scales. This review analyses the settlement process, attempting to integrate aspects related to different levels of organization (i.e. ecological-physiological-molecular). This is important because many factors that act at any of these levels and at different times can explain by themselves the patterns of settle- ment andlor recruitment of a large number of species. From an ecological perspective, progress has been made in the identification of causal factors of vanations in larval availability for settlement. Many physical and ethological factors that act during settlement have, however, not received much attention. Likewise, since the great majority of settlement studies have been carried out at restricted spatial scales, fewer works consider different biological and physical factors acting at different scales simulta- neously. Settlement patterns are frequently inferred from recruitment. In this sense, a density-indepen- dent action of post-settlement mortality has been cons{\~{}}dered as prerequisite for thls type of inference. This has, however, recently been challenged on the basis that settler-recruit and mortality-settler den- sity relationships change in time. At the physiological-molecular level, different settlement-inducing chemical cues have been identified. Those cues have, however, not yet been characterized to under- stand better the signal transduction mechanisms involved in larval responses. It is likely that the ner- vous system is involved. The use of artificial inducers would be useful in studying settlement induction, until more effective natural inducers are isolated and characterized Although few studies have ana- lysed the acquisition of competence, stages of larval development have been related to changes in pro- tein patterns or enzymatic levels of the nervous system. An inopportune exposure of larvae to inducers may delay settlement and may even have a negative impact on growth and subsequent survival of juveniles.},

The complex of factors that influence these coefficients make interpretations tricky and nonintuitive at times. Very often, inappropriate inferencesare made for a variety of reasons. In this paperwe discuss several important issues that relate to the interpretation of regression and path coefficients. We begin with a consideration of multiple regression. Here we discuss the different types of coefficients that can be obtained and their interpretations, with our focus on the contrast between unstandardized and standardized coefficients. Structural equation modelingis used to show how models that better match the theoretical relations among variables can enhance interpretabilityand lead to quite different conclusions. Here we again emphasize often-ignored aspects of the use of standardized coefficients. An alternative means of standardization based on the ``relevant ranges'' of variables is discussed as a means of standardization that can enhance interpretability.},

S group mussels were 2-8 yr old, M group mussels 2-9 yr old, and L group mussels 3-10 yr old. Absolute and weight-specific growth rates were determined from the beginning of the growth season (May) to the time of sampling (August). Respiration rates were measured in individuals from all size groups. Net growth efficiency coefficients were calculated, Malondialdehyde (NIDA) and fluorescent age pigment (FAP) concentrations were determined as a measure of lipid peroxidation. The level of antioxidant defence was estimated from superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in whole body homogenates, Metabolic performance was found to be a function of both age and body size, Weight-specific growth rates and net growth efficiencies decreased with age until mussels reached a 'critical' age, beyond which growth virtually stopped, Respiration rates were size dependent, but did not show a clear correlation with age. MDA levels remained unrelated to both age and body size, whereas FAP accumulation increased exponentially with age. However, FAP levels correlated negatively with size (growth rate), At constant body size, SOD and CAT activities did not display clear age-related changes; however, CAT activity decreased significantly with increasing body size, As a corollary, size effects potentially mimic age effects on key physiological functions of continuously growing species, and this needs to be considered in physiological studies of the ageing process.},

abstract = {Larval reef fish possess considerable swimming and sensory abilities, which could enable navigation towards settlement habitat from the open ocean. Due to their small size and relatively low survival, tagging individual larvae is not a viable option, but numerical modeling studies have proven useful for understanding the role of orientation throughout ontogeny. Here we combined the theoretical framework of the biased correlated random walk model with a very high resolution three-dimensional coupled biophysical model to investigate the role of orientation behavior in fish larvae. Virtual larvae of the bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) were released daily during their peak spawning period from two locations in the Florida Keys Reef Tract, a region of complex eddy fields bounded by the strong Florida Current. The larvae began orientation behavior either before or during flexion, and only larvae that were within a given maximum detection distance from the reef were allowed to orient. They were subjected to ontogenetic vertical migration, increased their swimming speed during ontogeny, and settled on reefs within a flexible window of 24 to 32 days of pelagic duration. Early orientation, as well as a large maximum detection distance, increased settlement, implying that the early use of large-scale cues increases survival. Orientation behavior also increased the number of larvae that settled near their home reef, providing evidence that orientation is a mechanism driving self-recruitment. This study demonstrates that despite the low swimming abilities of the earliest larval stages, orientation during this "critical period" would have remarkable demographic consequences. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests an important role of oxidant-induced damage in the progress of senescent changes, providing support for the free radical theory of aging proposed by Harman in 1956. However, considering that biological organisms continuously renew their structures, it is not clear why oxidative damage should accumulate with age. No strong evidence has been provided in favor of the concept of aging as an accumulation of synthetic errors (e.g. Orgel's 'error-catastrophe' theory and the somatic mutation theory). Rather, we believe that the process of aging may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged, relatively indigestible material, the accumulation of which further hinders cellular catabolic and anabolic functions. From this perspective, it might be predicted that: (i) suppression of oxidative damage would enhance longevity; (ii) accumulation of incompletely digested material (e.g. lipofuscin pigment) would interfere with cellular functions and increase probability of death; (iii) rejuvenation during reproduction is mainly provided by dilution of undigested material associated with intensive growth of the developing organism; and (iv) age-related damage starts to accumulate substantially when development is complete, and mainly affects postmitotic, cells and extracellular matrix, not proliferating cells. There is abundant support for all these predictions.},

METHODOLOGY: By accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of Bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty.

CONCLUSIONS: We outline a framework that builds on recently published Bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source R package, SIAR. The formulation in R will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many spatial interpolation methods perform well for gentle terrains when producing spatially continuous surfaces based on ground point data. However, few interpolation methods perform satisfactorily for complex terrains. Our objective in the present study was to analyze the suitability of several popular interpolation methods for complex terrains and propose an optimal method. A data set of 153 soil water profiles (1 m) from the semiarid hilly gully Loess Plateau of China was used, generated under a wide range of land use types, vegetation types and topographic positions. Four spatial interpolation methods, including ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighting, linear regression and regression kriging were used for modeling, randomly partitioning the data set into 2/3 for model fit and 1/3 for independent testing. The performance of each method was assessed quantitatively in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error, root-mean-square-error, and goodness-of-prediction statistic. The results showed that the prediction accuracy differed significantly between each method in complex terrain. The ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted methods performed poorly due to the poor spatial autocorrelation of soil moisture at small catchment scale with complex terrain, where the environmental impact factors were discontinuous in space. The linear regression model was much more suitable to the complex terrain than the former two distance-based methods, but the predicted soil moisture changed too sharply near the boundary of the land use types and junction of the sunny (southern) and shady (northern) slopes, which was inconsistent with reality because soil moisture should change gradually in short distance due to its mobility in soil. The most optimal interpolation method in this study for the complex terrain was the hybrid regression kriging, which produced a detailed, reasonable prediction map with better accuracy and prediction effectiveness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents a practical numerical method for separating and estimating growth and mortality coefficients in stage- or size-structured populations using only observations of the relative or absolute abundance of each stage. The method involves writing a system of linear ordinary differ- ential equations (ODEs) modelling the rate of change of abundance. The solution of the differential system can be numerically approximated using standard (e.g. sixth-order Runge-Kutta-Felhberg) methods. An optimization problem whose solutions yield 'optimal' coefficients for a given model is formulated. The ODE numerical integration technique can then be employed to furnish required function and gradient information to the optimization algorithm. The data-fitting software package ODRPACK is then successfully employed to estimate optimal coefficients for the ODE population model. Simulation experiments with four- and eight-stage model populations illustrate that the method results in the successful estimation of coefficients of mortality and growth from abundance data.},

Juvenile three-spot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons) were more closely aggregated in patch reef habitat than on continuous back reef. Agonistic interactions were more frequent but feeding rates were lower in the patch versus the continuous reef habitat. Growth rates were lower in patch reef habitat than on the continuous reef, but mortality rates did not differ. A separate experiment using standard habitat units demonstrated that the patterns observed in natural habitat were the result of the spatial distribution of the habitat patches rather than resource differences between habitats. Our results do not follow the predictions of simple IFD or IDD models. This deviation from IFD and IDD predictions may be the result of a number of factors, including lack of perfect information about habitat patches, high movement costs, and higher encounter rates of dispersed patches. Our results demonstrate that behavioral interactions are an integral part of population dynamics and that it is necessary to consider the spatial organization of the habitat in both behavioral and ecological investigations.},

An age dependent accumulation of lipofuscin concentration (expressed as {\%} area fraction) occurred (Y = -2.22 + 0.084X, R2 = 46.8{\%}, p ??? 0.0001 and incorporating carapace length as a covariate). Carapace length accounted for 3.3{\%} of the variation in lipofuscin. The effect of temperature on lipofuscin accumulation was assessed using three regimes: 8, 11 and 13.5??5??C. Temperature had a significant effect on lipofuscin accumulation (F = 15.9, p ??? 0.0009). Carapace length also responded significantly to temperature although the trend was not linear (F = 68.1, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between lipofuscin concentration and body size in lobsters of the same age (r = 0.067, -0.2, 0.154 and 0.5 for each of four groups). The age dependent increase in morphological lipofuscin and the lack of correlation between body size and lipofuscin in cultured H. gammarus indicates significant potential for this technique as a method of ageing lobsters. As lipofuscin accumulation is a function of metabolic age, factors other than temperature, such as population density, which affects growth rate in the wild, could potentially affect metabolic rate and therefore lipofuscin accumulation. However the independence between growth and lipofuscin in laboratory animals indicates that this may not be a problem.},

abstract = {Fatty acids have been used as qualitative markers to trace or confirm predator prey relationships in the marine environment for more than thirty years. More recently, they have also been used to identify key processes impacting the dynamics of some of the world's major ecosystems. The fatty acid trophic marker (FA TM) concept is based on the observation that marine primary producers lay down certain fatty acid patterns that may, be transferred conservatively to, and hence can be recognized in, primary consumers. To identify these fatty acid patterns the literature was surveyed and a partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis of the data was performed, validating the specificity of particular microalgal FATM. Microalgal group specific FA TM have been traced in various primary consumers, particularly in herbivorous calanoid copepods, which accumulate large lipid reserves, and which dominate the zooplankton biomass in high latitude ecosystems. At higher trophic levels these markers of herbivory are obscured as the degree of carnivory increases, and as the fatty acids originate from a variety of dietary sources. Such differences are highlighted in a PLS regression analysis of fatty acid and fatty alcohol compositional data (the components of wax esters accumulated by many marine organisms) of key Arctic and Antarctic herbivorous, omnivorous and carnivorous copepod species. The analysis emphasizes how calanoid copepods separate from other copepods not only by their content of microalgal group specific FATM, but also by their large content of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and alcohols. These monounsaturates have been used to trace and resolve food web relationships in, for example, hyperiid amphipods, euphausiids and fish, which may consume large numbers of calanoid copepods. Results like these are extremely valuable for enabling the discrimination of specific prey species utilized by higher trophic level omnivores and carnivores without the employment of invasive techniques, the thereby for identifying the sources of energetic reseves. A conceptual model of the spatial and temporal dominance of group-specific promary producers, and hence the basic fatty acid patterns available to higher trophic levels is presented. The model is based on stratification, which acts on phytoplankton group dominance through the availability of light and nutrients. It predicts the seasonal and ecosystem specific contribution of diatom and flagellate/microbial loop FATM to food webs as a function of water column stability. Future prospects for the application of FATM in resolving dynamic ecosystem processes are assessed.},

The results of the 3 approaches confirmed the high importance of microphytobenthos as a food source for (surface) deposit feeders. Despite the clearly demonstrated resuspension of benthic algae at high current velocities, suspension feeders appeared to depend almost exclusively on pelagic algae (and possibly detrital carbon) as a food source. Based on the results of the experiments, we determined an approximate degree of dependence on microphytobenthos for different species of intertidal macrobenthos. The macrobenthic biomass at 5 study locations, when weighted by these coefficients, correlated very well with measured productivity of the microphytobenthos.},

Particular emphasis was given to the use of $\delta$15N as a tracer of the origin of organic matter and as a means of determining the benthic food web structure in estuarine environments. $\delta$15N values indicated that there was direct utilisation of benthic diatoms as a food source by oyster Crassostrea gigas near intertidal mudflats but suggested trophic mediation between terrestrial detritus and oysters in the upper estuarine reaches. $\delta$15N data showed that the trophic position of oysters may vary in the estuarine bay. The $\delta$15N values for the other invertebrates investigated revealed that apparent discrepancies may occur concerning the correspondence between $\delta$15N, trophic level and feeding mode of invertebrates in estuarine ecosystems. In fact, these results suggest that $\delta$15N can be a useful tool to characterise trophic transfers and to establish an isotopic food web model, provided that one considers the different feeding habitats along the estuarine gradient.

abstract = {Accurate estimates of the diets of predators are required in many areas of ecology, but for many species current methods are imprecise, limited to the last meal, and often biased. The diversity of fatty acids and their patterns in organisms, coupled with the narrow limitations on their biosynthesis, properties of digestion in monogastric animals, and the prevalence of large storage reservoirs of lipid in many predators, led us to propose the use of quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) to study predator diets. We present a statistical model that provides quantitative estimates of the proportions of prey species in the diets of individual predators using fatty acid signatures. We conducted simulation studies using a database of 28 prey species (n   954 individuals) from the Scotian Shelf off eastern Canada to investigate properties of the model and to evaluate the reliability with which prey could be distinguished in the model. We then conducted experiments on grey seals (Halichoerus grypus, n   25) and harp seals (Phoca groenlandica, n   5) to assess quantitative characteristics of fatty acid deposition and to develop calibration coefficients for individual fatty acids to account for predator lipid metabolism. We then tested the model and calibration coefficients by estimating the diets of experimentally fed captive grey seals (n   6, switched from herring to a mackerel/capelin diet) and mink kits (Mustela vison, n   46, switched from milk to one of three oil-supplemented diets). The diets of all experimentally fed animals were generally well estimated using QFASA and were consistent with qualitative and quantitative expectations, provided that appropriate calibration coefficients were used. In a final case, we compared video data of foraging by individual freeranging harbor seals (Phoca vitulina, n   23) fitted with Crittercams and QFASA estimates of the diet of those same seals using a complex ecosystem-wide prey database. Among the 28 prey species in the database, QFASA estimated sandlance to be the dominant prey species in the diet of all seals (averaging 62{\%} of diet), followed primarily by flounders, but also capelin and minor amounts of other species, although there was also considerable individual variability among seals. These estimates were consistent with video data showing sandlance to be the predominant prey, followed by flatfish. We conclude that QFASA provides estimates of diets for individuals at time scales that are relevant to the ecological processes affecting survival, and can be used to study diet variability within individuals over time, which will provide important opportunities rarely possible with other indirect methods. We propose that the QFASA model we have set forth will be applicable to a wide range of predators and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Climate change will modify ecosystems, but a dearth of long-term data sets on critical ecological factors makes prediction of mechanistic pathways and scope for ecological changes difficult. Using 14-18 year time series of phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment at up to 10 sites along 320 km of coast in a rocky intertidal ecosystem, we examined the influence of climatic variation at 3-7 year (El Nino-Southern Oscillation [ENSO]), 7-10 year (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation [NPGO]), and 20+ year (Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]) timescales. Phytoplankton and mussel recruitment revealed order-of-magnitude increases and seasonal shifts in the 2000s compared to 1989-1999, but seasonal shifts were in opposite directions with phytoplankton blooms occurring earlier and recruitment occurring later in the year. The NPGO had the strongest relationships with both phytoplankton and recruitment, while relationships between these factors and ENSO and PDO were weak. Increases were associated with cooler ocean temperature and intensification in the ocean gyre-scale circulation reflected in a stronger North Pacific Current (NPC). Phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment were positively correlated, suggesting that increases in larval food may have driven the changes in mussel recruitment. With our prior demonstration that mussel growth rate is sensitive to phytoplankton concentration, these results suggest an important effect of bottom-up forcing on the dynamics of coastal mussel populations. We conclude that central supply-side ecological processes in coastal ecosystems are sensitive to long-term ocean basin-scale oceanographic and atmospheric fluctuation. Despite these changes, intertidal community dynamics have changed only in relatively subtle ways, suggesting a role for local ecological interactions in dampening the effects of dominant modes of climate forcings in coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

abstract = {The amount of isotopic fractionation (change in isotope ratios) between diet and animal tissues is generally poorly known and may be affected by trophic position. Diet–tissue fractionation of stable-carbon and -nitrogen isotopes was measured in several tissues of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) raised on a commercial pellet feed. Stable carbon isotopic fractionation in red fox was positive for all tissues and was greatest in fur (2.6‰), intermediate in muscle (1.1‰), and least in liver and blood fractions (0.4–0.6‰). These carbon isotope fractionation values were greater than those previ- ously measured for mammalian herbivores but were similar to values for marine mammals in most tissues. Little varia- tion in stable nitrogen isotopic fractionation occurred among tissues, except in the blood fractions. Nitrogen isotopic fractionation was much higher in blood serum (4.2‰) than in liver, muscle, and fur (3.3–3.5‰). Cellular fractions of blood had the lowest fractionation values (2.6‰). There was a significant age effect in nitrogen- but not in carbon- isotopic fractionation. Subadult foxes ({\textless}1 year) were significantly enriched in 15N compared with adult foxes for fur, muscle, and liver (no blood was collected from adults). The cause of this enrichment is unclear, but it may be related to the higher rate of protein synthesis and catabolism in growing animals. This study is the first to report isotopic frac- tionation values for a terrestrial mammalian carnivore. Such estimates are necessary to interpret stable-isotope patterns in wild carnivores.},

abstract = {Similar to pelagic larval dispersal, it has been suggested that dispersal of post-larval benthic organisms and species with direct development plays an important role in population persistence. However, effective dispersal distances required for the maintenance of local populations have been poorly characterized. This study elucidated distance effects on patterns and processes in dispersal of the amphipod Incisocalliope symbioticus, which is associated exclusively with the gorgoman octocoral Melithaea flabellifera. Dispersal patterns over an annual cycle were examined by the placement of defaunated gorgonians at 3 distance levels ({\textless} 0.2, 8, 70 m) for 1 wk. With an increase in distance from the source population, the dispersal rate decreased; conversely, the proportion of females and large individuals increased. This result suggested that colonizers that dispersed over long distances had the potential for rapid establishment of breeding aggregations, and therefore were responsible for the maintenance of local populations. Furthermore, the short-distance dispersal within a local population was dependent on the density of the resident population, whereas middle-and long-distance dispersal resulted from density-independent passive transport, driven by typhoon and storm events. Results of direct observations on the movements of live and, as a control, dead amphipods toward a gorgonian patch in the field showed that the amphipods had sufficient swimming ability (3.4 m min(-1)) for short-distance dispersal, and actively selected to move toward the patch. These results indicated that the combination of passive transport and the active selection enables the amphipod to migrate over long distances among local populations, even though the habitat of the amphipod only occurs sporadically.},

The energetic cost savings realized by the organism is a consequence primarily of the ability to depress ion pumping activities of cells, macromolecular synthesis, and macromolecular turnover. Evidence supporting the concept of channel arrest-the reduction in ion leakage across cell membranes during hypometabolic states-has highlighted the energetic benefits of limiting ATP turnover related to cellular ion homeostasis. Depression of protein synthesis results in substantial bioenergetic savings. However, when protein synthesis is arrested, the preservation of macromolecules becomes increasingly important as the duration of quiescence is extended because the cellular capacity for replenishing these components is reduced. It is likely that the rate of macromolecular degradation is a key feature that sets the upper time limit for survival during chronic environmental stress.},

Thus, once the eutrophication process is engaged-that is, high organic matter sedimentation-it may be indirectly favoured by benthic organisms; benthos should always be considered in eutrophication studies, (iii) to evaluate the limits of our observations and data, highlighting the strong need for integrated studies leading to new concepts. Coastal ecosystems and benthic communities are potentially impacted by numerous human activities (demersal fishing, toxic contaminants, aquaculture...); in order to design strategies of ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation, we have to better understand coastal eutrophication and develop tools for quantifying the impacts; in order to achieve this goal, some possible directions proposed are: integrated studies leading to new concepts, model development based on these concepts and finally comparison of various ecosystems on a global scale.},

abstract = {Complex 3D biological-physical models are becoming widely used in marine and freshwater ecology. These models are highly valued synthesizing tools because they provide insights into complex dynamics that are difficult to understand using purely empirical methods or theoretical analytical models. Of particular interest has been the incorporation of concentration-based copepod population dynamics into 3D physical transport models. These physical models typically have large numbers of grid points and therefore require a simplified biological model. However, concentration-based copepod models have used a fine resolution age-stage structure to prevent artificially short generation times, known as numerical ‘diffusion.' This increased resolution has precluded use of age-stage structured copepod models in 3D physical models due to computational constraints. In this paper, we describe a new method, which tracks the mean age of each life stage instead of using age classes within each stage. We then compare this model to previous age-stage structured models. A probability model is developed with the molting rate derived from the mean age of the population and the probability density function (PDF) of molting. The effects of temperature and mortality on copepod population dynamics are also discussed. The mean-age method effectively removes the numerical diffusion problem and reproduces observed median development times (MDTs) without the need for a high-resolution age-stage structure.

abstract = {The carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of organic matter has been widely used to trace biogeochemical processes in marine and lacustrine environments. In order to reconstruct past environmental changes from sedimentary organic matter, it is crucial to consider potential alteration of the primary isotopic signal by bacterial degradation in the water column and during early diagenesis in the sediments.In a series of oxic and anoxic incubation experiments, we examined the fate of organic matter and the alteration of its carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition during microbial degradation. The decomposition rates determined with a double-exponential decay model show that the more reactive fraction of organic matter degrades at similar rates under oxic and anoxic conditions. However, under oxic conditions the proportion of organic matter resistent to degradation is much lower than under anoxic conditions. Within three months of incubation the $\delta$13C of bulk organic matter decreased by 1.6‰ with respect to the initial value. The depletion can be attributed to the selective preservation of 13C-depleted organic compounds. During anoxic decay, the $\delta$15N values continuously decreased to about 3‰ below the initial value. The decrease probably results from bacterial growth adding 15N-depleted biomass to the residual material. In the oxic experiment, $\delta$15N values increased by more then 3‰ before decreasing to a value indistinguishable from the initial isotopic composition. The dissimilarity between oxic and anoxic conditions may be attributed to differences in the type, timing and degree of microbial activity and preferential degradation. In agreement with the anoxic incubation experiments, sediments from eutrophic Lake Lugano are, on average, depleted in 13C ( -1.5‰) and 15N ( -1,2‰) with respect to sinking particulate organic matter collected during a long-term sediment trap study. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Spatial homogeneity is the exception, not the rule, for many marine populations. Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of 'true' population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Understanding the chemical and C, N isotopic alteration of organic matter (OM) during early diagenesis is crucial to the studies of biogeochemical processes in marine and lacustrine environments. In this study, isotopic composition (??13C and ??15N), total organic carbon and total nitrogen content of sediment cores, plankton and particulate organic matter (POM) from the coastal area off-shore the Pearl River estuary were determined. In addition, the fractional carbon content of total hydrolysable amino acids, total carbohydrates, total lipids and acid-insoluble organic compounds and their respective ??13C were analyzed. The ??13Corg of sediment cores from geographically distinct sites (C5 and E4) is fairly constant and just slightly lower than that of the plankton, suggesting that ??13C can be used as a reliable geochemical proxy indicating OM origin in the studied coastal area. Considerable diagenetic alteration of OC/N was observed, and the diagenetic alteration of ??15N was significant. A rapid degradation of OM was associated with a rapid bacteria growth in the water column, which governed the diagenesis of the OM. In addition to the kinetic isotopic fractionation associated with the biodegradation of OM, formation and degradation of bacterial biomass contributed significantly to the observed change of ??13C and ??15N during diagenesis. Although the bacteria biomass was believed to be rich in 13C relative to the substrate, bacteria biosynthesis also produced 13C-rich and 13C-poor fractions, and the subsequent biodegradation preferentially decomposes the 13C-rich compound classes and the 13C-rich compounds in a specific class as well, which made the ??13C of remaining organic matter similar to the substrate in the sediment. On the other hand, the low ??15N of the POM and sedimentary OM relative to the fresh plankton was resulted from the addition of 15N-depleted biomass that was possibly generated by the preferential uptake of 15N-depleted ammonium during bacterial growth. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, spatial considerations are generally ignored in fishery stock assessment and management because of a lack of spatially explicit data and poor understanding of the spatial dynamics of most fisheries. This study uses a simulation approach to evaluate the consequences of misspecifying spatial structure and migration during the assessment process. We developed an operating model to simulate a fishery using US Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as our model species. This population consists of two well-defined spawning substocks distributed and mixed in four management areas. Simulations were done for three alternative “true” populations, each having a different spatial structure both biologically and with regard to the geographic distribution of fishing effort. Stock assessments were then performed for the three simulated “true” populations using standard methodologies and assumptions currently used. Management-area...},

abstract = {We investigated the distribution of meroplankton and water properties off southern Washington and simultaneously measured time series of larval abundance and water properties in two adjacent estuaries, Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay. The cruise period, in late May 1999, coincided with large variation in the alongshore wind stress that caused dynamic change in the position of the Columbia River plume, coastal upwelling and downwelling, and offshore salinity variation, and were found throughout the surveyed area in both plume and recently upwelled waters. Megalopae of kelp crab (Pugettia producta) and hermit crab (Pagurus spp.) were more abundant in upwelled water and low numbers were caught in the plume water. Barnacle cyprids appeared to track the advective transport suggesting that they may be more passively dispersed. Within the estuaries, hydrography responded rapidly and synchronously to variation in wind stress. Intrusions of both plume and newly upwelled waters were detected at estuarine sites, depending on the type of water present at the coast, indicating a tight link between the estuaries and the coastal ocean in this region. A 90-d record of C. magister megalopae abundance was made at 3 estuarine sites using light traps. The bulk of the C. magister recruit- ment was limited to a relatively brief period in late May through June. Within this window, megalopae occurred in distinct phytoplankton production. In the coastal ocean, meroplankton groups responded differently to this wind event and the associated advection of water masses. Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) megalopae were largely indifferent to the wide pulses of 3-5 d interspaced with periods of low or zero abundance. C. magister megalopae recruited to the estuaries over a wide range of wind forcing, and were transported into the estuary within varied water types. There were no periodic patterns indicative of spring-neap tidal variations in the abundance time series. Abundance was only weakly cross-correlated between the adjacent Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay estuaries, which contrasts with the more synchronous estuarine-coastal linkages measured for water properties. These results suggest the interaction of larval aggregation size in the ocean with estuary-ocean exchange processes likely controls patterns of estuarine recruitment.},

abstract = {A major challenge to ecologists is identifying factors that make a system susceptible to regime shifts or state transitions. Theory and modelling have suggested a number of indicators to warn of approaching tipping points, but empirical tests of their validity are few. We tested 2 indicators, change to a key species and increased temporal variability, in a harbour, a system type rarely studied for regime shifts and alternate states. Long-term monitoring over 20 yr on a number of intertidal sandflats allowed us to document change and determine potential contributing factors. We detected decreasing abundance in the key species and increased temporal variability (flickering) of community composition before a trophic and functional change to an alternate community type. Detection of these indicators occurred despite cyclic patterns in community and population dynamics and a relatively fast and permanent change of one external condition (nutrients). We provide evidence that this shift was the product of a relatively small change in management of sewage disposal, combined with climate dynamics and mediated through changes in a key species, a tubeworm that provides biogenic habitat structure, stabilises sediment and affects dispersal and recruitment. These factors all interacted to escalate the effect of the relatively small changes in nutrients across a tipping point. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {There is a growing effort to use predictions of the physical state of the ocean under climate change to forecast the response of marine ecosystems. Many of these forecasts use ecosystem models rather than age-structured population models to describe upper trophic level (UTL) species. We illustrate the potential effects of climate on age-structured populations, then illustrate the ways in which ecosystem models might not depict adequately: (i) long-term changes in abundance, and (ii) variability attributable to cohort resonance. We simulated two generic species with different life histories, a short-lived semelparous species (e.g. salmon), and a long-lived iteroparous species (e.g. cod). For both species, juvenile survival was varied, first with white noise, then with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as environmental signals. Variability in recruitment increased with fishing and became particularly sensitive to forcing at time-scales near the mean age of reproduction, consistent with the cohort resonance effect. Ecosystem models without age structure do not predict this behaviour, particularly when the ecosystem model incorrectly predicts the effective steepness of the stock–recruitment relationship, or the age structure is approximated by a stage-structured model. We suggest that ecosystem models of UTLs include full representations of age structure, fitted to available population data.},

abstract = {The plight of the marine fisheries is attracting increasing attention as unsustainably high exploitation levels, exacerbated by more extreme climatic conditions, are driving stocks to the point of collapse. The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the safe biological limit since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for biocomplexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered.},

Tag-integrated models offer a promising approach for incorporating spatial structure and movement patterns in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstock assessments, but the complexity of the framework makes implementation challenging and the appraisal of performance$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifficult. A flounder-like fishery was simulated to emulate the metapopulation dynamics of the three yellowtail flounder$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(Limanda ferruginea) stocks off New England, and the robustness of spatially explicit tag-integrated models were compared with$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclosed population assessments. Different movement parametrizations and data uncertainty scenarios were simulated, while the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nability of the tag-integrated model to estimate reporting rate and time-varying movement were also evaluated. Results indicated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat the tag-integrated framework was robust for the simulated fishery across a wide range of connectivity levels and that tag$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreporting rates were accurately estimated. Closed population models also demonstrated limited error. Therefore, spatially$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexplicit approaches may not always be warranted even when regional connectivity is occurring, but tag-integrated models can$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprovide improved parameter estimates when reliable tagging data are available. Tag-integrated models also serve as valuable$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntools for informing spatially explicit operating models, which can then be used to evaluate the assumptions and performance of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclosed population models.},

abstract = {Juveniles of bivalves Mactra veneriformis and Ruditapes philippinarum, and ghost shrimps Nihonotrypaea japonica and N. harmandi were reared on a microalga of a constant isotopic value to quantify their diet-tissue isotopic fractionation. The weights of the animals increased by {\textgreater}7-fold, resulting in isotopic equilibria with their diet. Fractionation for bivalve soft tissues was 0.6 to 0.9‰ for carbon and 3.4 to 3.6‰ for nitrogen, which fell within the range of the currently accepted fractionation values (0 to 1 and 3 to 4‰). Examinations of acid-treated or untreated whole body, mus- cle and exoskeleton of the ghost shrimps showed (1) large variations in $\delta$13C for untreated exoskele- tons, (2) reduced $\delta$13C for acid-treated exoskeletons by 3.5 to 6.2‰, (3) confined ranges in 13C and 15N fractionations for muscles (2.0 to 2.2 and 3.6 to 4.0‰), (4) only slight effects of acid treatment on 13C and 15N fractionation for muscles (≤0.3‰ differences), (5) a significant difference in 13C fractionation for acid-treated whole bodies between N. japonica (–0.3‰) and N. harmandi (–1.7‰), and (6) 2.3 to 3.0‰ of 15N fractionation for whole bodies, which were smaller than for muscles due to negative frac- tionation for exoskeletons (–3.0 to –1.9‰). These findings suggest that carbonates in exoskeletons should be removed by acid and that muscle is the most appropriate tissue for isotopic analysis. Although 15N fractionation for ghost-shrimp muscle was within the above-mentioned accepted range, 13C fractionation was outside this range. The present study highlights that fractionation is species- and tissue-specific, and that the accepted fractionation values may not be universally applicable.},

Estuarial mixing of terrigenous, indigenous estuarine and marine derived organics, recorded by $\delta$13C data, was only partly confirmed by equivalent $\delta$15N and C/N compositions which reflected greater control by organic matter diagenesis and biological processing. Limited data indicate sewage derived contributions are insignificant. Of the three tracers employed, only $\delta$13C ratios are reliable as provenance indicators. Both $\delta$15N and C/N ratios are limited because the original POM source signature may be lost or overprinted by biochemical alteration prior to and/or soon after deposition. The simultaneous application of these tracers provides substantially more information regarding the source, quality and turnover of sedimentary POM in these contrasting systems than could be achieved using one technique alone.},

Management of eutrophication in the coastal zone has been hampered by the lack of a direct method to trace nitrogen sources from land into coastal food webs. Stable isotope data from a series of estuaries receiving nitrogen loads from 2 to 467 kg N ha-1 yr-1 from the Waquoit Bay watershed, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, indicate that producer and consumer 15N-to-14N ratios record increases in wastewater nitrogen inputs. Nitrate from groundwater-borne wastewater introduces a 15N-enriched tracer to estuaries. This study explicitly links anthropogenically derived nitrogen from watersheds to nitrogen in estuarine plants and animals, and suggests that wastewater nitrogen may be detectable in estuarine biota at relatively low loading rates, before eutrophication leads to major changes in species composition and abundance within estuarine food webs.},

Knowledge of the pollution sources and impacts on ecosystems is important not only for a better understanding on the ecosystem responses to pollutants but also to formulate prevention measures. Many of the sources of aquatic pollutions are generally well known and huge effort has been devoted to the issue. However, new concepts and ideas on environmental pollution are emerging (e.g., biological pollution) with a corresponding need for an update of the knowledge.

abstract = {The origin of variation in animal growth rate and body size is not well understood but central to ecological and evolutionary processes. We develop a relationship that predicts the change in relative body size variation within a cohort will be approximately equal to the relative change in mean per unit size growth rate, when only size-dependent factors affect growth. When modeling cohort growth, relative size variation decreased, remained unchanged, or increased, as a function of growth rate-size scaling relationships, in a predictable manner. We use the approximation to predict how environmental factors (e.g., resource level) affect body size variation, and verified these predictions numerically for a flexible growth model using a wide range of parameter values. We also explore and discuss the assumptions underlying the approximation. We find that factors that similarly affect mean growth rate may differently affect size variation, and competition may increase body size variation without changing size-independent relationships. We discuss implications of our results to the choice of growth equations used in models where body size variation is an important variable or output.},

These are the stages in the life cycle that are most subject to the vagaries of the environment, while potentially reproductive adults tend to have both higher average survivorship and more predictable survivorship. It follows that recruitment to the adult population is often much more variable than adult survivorship. This difference in variability is increased in some species by a tendency of adults to reduce reproductive effort when conditions are poor thus increasing their own survivorship or enhancing later reproductive success (Murdoch 1966, Goodman 1974, Nichols et al. 1976, Tyler and Dunn 1976).},

In principle, the dynamics and interactions of all stages could play a major role in the regulation of adult populations and species assemblages. In practice, however, the roles of larger and more sedentary phases - being easier to count and manipulate than motile propagules - have been emphasized. Nonetheless, several recent studies on the small, dispersing larval phase of marine invertebrate life cycles reach the conclusion that the spatial distribution and supply of propagules can control the distribution and abundance of populations of benthic adults. To some, the present emphasis on planktonic propagules amounts to a resurrection of ideas developed during a long and rich history of larval biology. To others, studies of demographic and ecological connections between larval and adult populations represent a substantial revision of ecological paradigms.},

abstract = {Failure of female reproductive capacity in the copepod Calanus helgolandicus was related to number and combination of the phytoplankton species in the diets. The maternal food effects were detectable at different levels: fecundity, oogenesis and hatching. Fecundity and hatching were normal with two single (ca. Isochrysis galbana and Prorocentrum minimum) and one mixed (Phaeodactylum tricornutum + Dunaliella tertiolecta + Pavlova lutherii + I. galbana + P. minimum) diets. With the single P. lutherii diet, fecundity decreased, but hatching remained optimal. The daily egg production and hatching rates decreased significantly in females fed the other single P. tricornutum, D. tertiolecta and mixed (P. tricornutum + D. tertiolecta + P. lutherii + I. galbana) diets, or starved. The fecundity decrease coincided with gonad atresia, which was reversible when P. tricornutum and P. lutherii diets were replaced by P. minimum diet. It was irreversible when D. tertiolecta was replaced by P. minimum, leading to female sterilization expressed by the deterioration of OS3 and OS2 oocytes, as a function of the feeding duration. We assume that atresia of female gonads was caused by the limitation of essential nutrients in food, such as fatty acids, which induced catabolism and recycling of yolk reserves and thus, maintenance of gonad integrity and low spawning rates. With the D. tertiolecta diet, abnormally high increase of ornithine concentrations in eggs showed that the ornithine metabolism and polyamine pathway were affected during oogenesis, leading atresia of oocytes to be deeply disturbed and followed up by necrosis of the gonads. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sediment grazing and burrowing activities of natural populations of Mictyris longicarpus on benthic metabolism, nitrogen flux and irrigation rates by comparing sediments taken from minimum disturbance exclusion cages and adjacent sediments subject to M. longicarpus activities. M. longicarpus reduced sediment surface chlorophyll a (approximately 77{\%}), organic carbon (approximately 95{\%}) and total nitrogen concentrations (approximately 99{\%}) in comparison to ungrazed sediments. Consequently, they significantly reduced gross benthic O2 production (about 71{\%}) and sediment O2 consumption (approximately 46{\%}). Mean N2 fluxes showed net effluxes (276-430 ??mol m-2 day-1) in the presences of M. longicarpus and net uptakes (194.09-449.21 ??mol m-2 day-1) where they were excluded. The net uptake of N2 was most likely due to cyanobacteria fixing of N2, as dense microbial mats became established over the sediment surface in the absence of M. longicarpus grazing activity. Sediment irrigation/transport rates calculated from CsCl tracer dilution indicated greater irrigation rates in the exclusions (12.12-16.22 l m-2 h -1) compared to inhabited sediments (6.33-11.73 l m-2 h-1) and this was again was most likely due to the lack of grazing pressure which allowed large populations of small burrowing polychaetes to inhabit the organic matter rich exclusion sediments. As such, the main influence of M. longicarpus was the interception and consumption of transported organic material, benthic microalgae and other small infaunal organisms resulting in the removal of approximately 0.06 g m-2 day-1 of nitrogen and 12.12 g m-2 day-1 of organic carbon. This "cleansing" of the sediments reduced sediment metabolism and the flux of solutes across the sediment water interface and ultimately the heavy predation of M. longicarpus by transient species such as stingrays, results in a net loss of carbon and nitrogen from the system. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Kendall1998,
abstract = {Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population dynamics: It can generate spatial structure, in which individuals interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics, and it allows for environmental heterogeneity, in which habitat quality varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models, to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two patches coupled by dispersal, with dynamics in each patch governed by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters, this model can represent spatial structure, environmental heterogeneity, or both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses on this model, with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models, and to generate predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can generate positive, negative, or zero spatial correlations between patches when dispersal rates are high, medium, or low relative to the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity and hyperchaos, which are not present in the nonspatial model. With density-independent dispersal, spatial structure cannot destabilize equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated, the probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities is reduced relative to the same patch in isolation; this "rescue effect" would reduce the probability of metapopulation extinction beyond the simple effect of spreading of risk. Pure environmental heterogeneity always produces positive spatial correlations. The dynamics of the entire population is approximated by a nonspatial model with mean patch characteristics. This approximation worsens as the difference between the patches increases and the dispersal rate decreases: Under extreme conditions, destabilization of equilibria and periodic orbits occurs at mean parameter values lower than those predicted by the mean parameters. Apparent within-patch dynamics are distorted: The local population appears to have the wrong growth parameter and a constant number of immigrants (or emigrants) per generation. Adding environmental heterogeneity to spatial structure increases the occurrence of spatially correlated population dynamics, but the resulting temporal dynamics are more complex than would be predicted by the mean parameter values. The three classes of spatial pattern (positive, negative, and zero correlation), while still mathematically distinct, become increasingly similar phenomenologically.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify lipofuscin in the base of the olfactory nuclei of 10 laboratory- and 17 field-reared freshwater crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, 2.4-2.5 years of age. These data, with those from earlier studies, indicated that there was probably a slowing of lipofuscin accumulation and metabolic rate in large/old individuals between 1 and 2.4 years. The ranges of carapace length and body weight in the 2.4-yr laboratory group fell entirely within those of the 1-yr group. It was impossible to accurately distinguish individual crayfish from these age groups using traditional size criteria. Conversely, there was no overlap in the brain lipofuscin contents of individuals from the two age classes, enabling 100{\%} differentiation on this criterion. Although increasing variation in lipofuscin concentrations and slowing of the accumulation rate with increasing age would lead to widening confidence intervals of age predictions for older individuals, the present results again demonstrate that, at least in these laboratory reared crayfish, lipofuscin is a much better predictor of age than conventionally used size indices. Despite a wide range of ambient water temperatures (7-33??C, mean 19??C), the variance of lipofuscin concentrations in the 2.5-yr-old field-grown crayfish was not significantly different from that of similarly aged individuals reared under constant laboratory conditions, suggesting that individuals in the population were relatively cohesive in their response to varying temperatures and that confidence levels for age determinations of field animals might be of the same order as those obtained for laboratory subjects. The results of the present study are further incentive for continuing the evaluation of lipofuscin as an index of crustacean age. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {We shall examine the impact of Charles S. Elton's 1924 article on periodic fluctuations in animal populations on the development of modern population ecology. We argue that his impact has been substantial and that during the past 75 years of research on multi-annual periodic fluctuations in numbers of voles, lemmings, hares, lynx and game animals he has contributed much to the contemporary understanding of the causes and consequences of population regulation. Elton was convinced that the cause of the regular fluctuations was climatic variation. To support this conclusion, he examined long-term population data then available. Despite his firm belief in a climatic cause of the self-repeating periodic dynamics which many species display, Elton was insightful and far-sighted enough to outline many of the other hypotheses since put forward as an explanation for the enigmatic long-term dynamics of some animal populations. An interesting, but largely neglected aspect in Elton's paper is that it ends with speculation regarding the evolutionary consequences of periodic population fluctuations. The modern understanding of these issues will also be scrutinised here. In population ecology, Elton's 1924 paper has spawned a whole industry of research on populations displaying multi-annual periodicity. Despite the efforts of numerous research teams and individuals focusing on the origins of multi-annual population cycles, and despite the early availability of different explanatory hypotheses, we are still lacking rigorous tests of some of these hypotheses and, consequently, a consensus of the causes of periodic fluctuations in animal populations. Although Elton would have been happy to see so much effort spent on cyclic populations, we also argue that it is unfortunate if this focus on a special case of population dynamics should distract our attention from more general problems in population and community dynamics.},

abstract = {Studies that use biomarkers to elucidate consumer diets often must assume that these signatures are relatively invariant in space and time. We tested this assumption for multiple stable isotopes (MSI: $\delta$13C, $\delta$15N, $\delta$34S) and fatty acids in 10 marine macrophytes (macroalgae and seagrass) on 3 different dates, and also quantified MSI at 3 sites in the coastal northeast Pacific. For all comparisons, we found significant variation in biomarkers among species, sites, and dates; furthermore, there were always significant site × species and date × species interaction terms, indicating that biomarkers do not change consistently across species among dates or sites. Despite this variation within and among species, biomarkers could readily distinguish macrophyte phyla. To observe how variation could affect conclusions about diets, we used a Bayesian mixing model to evaluate scenarios for a theoretical consumer given diverse diets, and with varying assumptions about the way it integrates foods over sites and seasons. Accuracy of the model runs (predicted diet versus simulated diet) increased with the number of biomarker variables, and depended strongly on initial assumptions about diets. The lowest accuracy occurred when biomarker values were based on macrophytes sampled only from 1 season but the consumer integrated foods across multiple seasons, a situation commonly seen in biomarker literature. Contrary to the notion that natural biomarker variation reduces insight into food web structure, exploring the potential mechanisms behind this variation should provide a more realistic view of coastal ecosystem dynamics},

abstract = {As mammals are unable to synthesize essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), these compounds need to be taken in through diet. Nowadays, obtaining essential PUFA in diet is becoming increasingly difficult; therefore this work investigated the suitability of using macroalgae as novel dietary sources of PUFA. Hence, 17 macroalgal species from three different phyla (Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta) were analyzed and their fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profile was assessed. Each phylum presented a characteristic fatty acid signature as evidenced by clustering of PUFA profiles of algae belonging to the same phylum in a Principal Components Analysis. The major PUFA detected in all phyla were C(18) and C(20), namely linoleic, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids. The obtained data showed that rhodophytes and phaeophytes have higher concentrations of PUFA, particularly from the n-3 series, thereby being a better source of these compounds. Moreover, rhodophytes and phaeophytes presented "healthier" ∑n-6/∑n-3 and PUFA/saturated fatty acid ratios than chlorophytes. Ulva was an exception within the Chlorophyta, as it presented high concentrations of n-3 PUFA, $\alpha$-linolenic acid in particular. In conclusion, macroalgae can be considered as a potential source for large-scale production of essential PUFA with wide applications in the nutraceutical and pharmacological industries.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are used as ecological tracers for a variety of applications, such as studies of animal migrations, energy sources, and food web pathways. Yet uncertainty relating to the time period integrated by isotopic measurement of animal tissues can confound the interpretation of isotopic data. There have been a large number of experimental isotopic diet shift studies aimed at quantifying animal tissue isotopic turnover rate $\lambda$ ({\%}·day(-1), often expressed as isotopic half-life, ln(2)/$\lambda$, days). Yet no studies have evaluated or summarized the many individual half-life estimates in an effort to both seek broad-scale patterns and characterize the degree of variability. Here, we collect previously published half-life estimates, examine how half-life is related to body size, and test for tissue- and taxa-varying allometric relationships. Half-life generally increases with animal body mass, and is longer in muscle and blood compared to plasma and internal organs. Half-life was longest in ecotherms, followed by mammals, and finally birds. For ectotherms, different taxa-tissue combinations had similar allometric slopes that generally matched predictions of metabolic theory. Half-life for ectotherms can be approximated as: ln (half-life) = 0.22*ln (body mass) + group-specific intercept; n = 261, p{\textless}0.0001, r2 = 0.63. For endothermic groups, relationships with body mass were weak and model slopes and intercepts were heterogeneous. While isotopic half-life can be approximated using simple allometric relationships for some taxa and tissue types, there is also a high degree of unexplained variation in our models. Our study highlights several strong and general patterns, though accurate prediction of isotopic half-life from readily available variables such as animal body mass remains elusive.},

abstract = {Shallow seagrass is an important habitat for many fish species, but little is known about fish distribution in deep seagrass or if depth affects fish distribution within patches. Using stereo video, fish distribution patterns in Port Phillip Bay, Australia, were examined in deep (3.5-6 m) and shallow ({\textless}1.5 m) areas over four months (December-March). Three positions were sampled in relation to seagrass patches; the interior of seagrass patches, at the edge of seagrass patches and over sand distant ({\textgreater}100 m) from seagrass. Recorded video was subsequently analysed using time in view (TiV) and MaxN, with fish showing strong responses to both depth and habitat type. Fish assemblages were different between deep and shallow seagrass, and many species were found only in shallow (e.g. Australian salmon, King George whiting, southern garfish) or deep (e.g. bridled leatherjackets, goatfish) seagrass. King George whiting spent more time at the edge than the middle of shallow patches, while TiV and MaxN indicated that garfish and odacids were more common in the middle than the edge of patches. Few species were observed over sand. Overall fish lengths were greater in shallow than deep seagrass and at the edge than middle of patches. Edge effects were found to occur in both deep and shallow seagrass and should be considered when designing sampling regimes and determining conservation strategies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The stock recruitment paradigm involves the hypothesis that recruitment (R) to a fish stock is positively related to the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of the stock, at low SSB. I propose a ''recruitment states'' hypothesis wherein R is independent of SSB but has different mean values during successive periods. Meta-analysis was used to test the null hypothesis that recruitment is a series of random, independent events, against these two alternative hypotheses, for 153 marine spawning bony fish stocks and 31 salmonid stocks. A test statistic for the stock recruitment paradigm, based on estimating derivatives from the first differences of the time series, was not significant for the marine stacks. The null hypothesis was rejected for the salmonid stocks. Recruitment states models significantly fitted time series for the marine stocks. Picker models also significantly fitted these data, conflicting with the derivatives test result. However, because SSB is dependent on R, lagged by the age at maturity, a period in a low recruitment state would tend to lead to a period of low SSB. Therefore, the significance of the fit to the Ricker model may have been spurious. The recruitment states model best explained the meta-dataset for the marine stocks.},

From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

These activities considerably modify their immediate environment and have made these cryptic animals extremely interesting to scientists in terms of their behavior, ecology, and classiﬁcation. Over 20 years ago, seven species of thalassinideans were known from the South Atlantic Bight (Cape Hatteras, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). During this study, the examination of extensive collections from the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), the Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center (SERTC), and regional institutions, resulted in the identiﬁcation of 14 species of thalassinideans currently known to occur within this region.

abstract = {Abstract  The residence and flushing times of an estuary are two different concepts that are often confused. Flushing time is the time required for the freshwater inflow to equal the amount of freshwater originally present in the estuary. It is specific to freshwater (or materials dissolved in it) and represents the transit time through the entire system (e.g., from head of tide to the mouth). Residence time is the average time particles take to escape the estuary. It can be calculated for any type of material and will vary depending on the starting location of the material. In the literature, the term residence time is often used to refer to the average freshwater transit time and is calculated as such. Freshwater transit time is a more precise term for a type of residence time (that of freshwater, starting from the head of the estuary), whereas residence time is a more general term that must be clarified by specifying the material and starting distribution. We explored these two mixing time scales in the context of the Altmaha River estuary, Georgia, and present a comparison of techniques for their calculation (fraction of freshwater models and variations of box models). Segmented tidal prism models, another common approach, have data requirements similar to other models but can be cumbersome to implement properly. Freshwater transit time estimates from simple steady-state box models were virtually, identical to flushing times for four river-flow cases, as long as boxes were scaled appropriately to river flow, and residence time estimates from different box models were also in good agreement. Mixing time estimates from box models, were incorrect when boxes were imporperly scaled. Mixing time scales vary nonlinearly with river flow, so characterizing the range as well as the mean or median is important for a thorough understanding of the potential for within-estuary processing. We are now developing an imporved box model that will allow the calculation of a variety of mixing time scales using simulations with daily variable river discharge.},

abstract = {The importance of cold-water coral (CWC) mounds and sponge-beds as habitat for demersal fish was examined in the Tr{\ae}na Deep marine protected area and adjacent areas of the Norwegian continental shelf. Standardised longline fishing was conducted twice, in June and March, and predetermined fishing effort was allocated to multiple plots with varying densities of small CWC mounds and sponges, plus control plots with neither of these habitats. Catches within all examined habitats were dominated by the commercially exploited Brosme brosme (representing {\textgreater}70{\%} of the total catch) followed by Galeus melastomus, Chimaera monstrosa, Etmopterus spinax and the commercially exploited Molva molva. Positive correlations were found between catch rates of B. brosme, G. melastomus and C. monstrosa and the density of small CWC mounds at one or both sampling occasions. No correlations were found between the catch rates of the same three species and sponge density; thus the sponge-beds did not seem to represent an ecologically equivalent habitat to the CWCs. On a local scale the CWC habitat appeared to attract higher abundances of B. brosme, G. melastomus and C. monstrosa; however, the differences in catch rates between coral and non-coral areas were quite low (2-4 times) and for most species the fish-habitat relationships varied temporarily and with the spatial scale used to delineate the habitat. Based on the methods and the results of this study and the fact that CWCs only occupy a very small proportion of the Norwegian shelf, the importance of CWCs as habitat for the populations of the demersal fish species examined is judged as marginal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

These spatial resampling-based estimation procedures were therefore implemented in a new package `sperrorest' for the open-source statistical data analysis software R.

abstract = {Freshwater fraction and tidal prism models are simple methods for estimating the turnover time of estuarine water. The freshwater fraction method prominently features flushing by freshwater inflow and has sometimes been criticized because it appears not to include flushing by seawater, but this is accounted for implicitly because the average estuary salinity used in the calculation reflects all the processes that bring seawater into the estuary, including gravitational circulation and tidal processes. The model relies on measurable salinity differences among water masses and so must be used for estuaries with substantial freshwater inflow. Tidal prism models are based on flushing by flood tide inflow and ignore seawater inflow due to gravitational circulation. These models should only be applied to estuaries with weak or nonexistent gravitational circulation, which are generally those with little freshwater inflow. Using a framework that is less ambiguous and more directly applicable to the estimation of turnover times. than those used previously, this paper critically examines the application of tidal prism models in well-mixed estuaries with complete tidal exchange, partial ebb return, or incomplete flood mixing and in partially mixed estuaries. Problems with self-consistency in earlier versions of these models also apply to the budgeting procedure used by the LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) program. Although freshwater fraction and tidal prism models are different approaches to estimating turnover times in systems with very different characteristics, consistent derivation shows that these models have much in common with each other and that they yield equivalent values that can be used to make comparisons across systems.},

This RE framework also accounts for the effects of selectivity on growth curve estimation by characterizing the distribution of true ages derived from multiple age reads using either an exponential or gamma distribution. Simulation testing across four life histories is used to compare the RE approach with standard nonlinear (SNL) approaches that use the primary, average, or median ages in growth estimation. Sensitivity tests compare the effects of assumed length and ageing error, selectivity, and recruitment variability on the estimation of growth curve parameters. Results support the use of the RE method using a gamma distribution over the SNL methods because RE method estimates of VBGF growth parameters were more precise across life histories and sensitivity trials. This general approach can be applied and expanded to other growth models. Applications demonstrate that the results from RE methods may differ in biologically important ways to those obtained from SNL approaches.},

abstract = {Overfishing is a major environmental problem in the oceans. In addition to the direct loss of the exploited species, the very act of fishing, particularly with mobile bottom gear, destroys habitat and ultimately results in the loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, overfishing can create trophic cascades in marine communities that cause similar declines in species richness. These effects are compounded by indirect effects on habitat that occur through removal of ecological or ecosystem engineers. Mass removal of species that restructure the architecture of habitat and thus increase its complexity or influence the biogeochemistry of sediments could have devastating effects on local biodiversity and important water-sediment processes. The possible overexploitation of engineering species requires more attention because the consequences extend beyond their own decline to affect the rest of the ecosystem. This is particularly problematic in the deep ocean, where oil and gas exploration and fishing pressure are likely to increase.},

For example, age-specific survival rates can be estimated with just a single sample from the age distribution of a stable, stationary population. For a population that is not stable, age-specific survival rates can be estimated using techniques such as inverse methods that combine time series of age-structure data with other demographic data. However, estimation of survival rates using these methods typically requires numerical optimization, a relatively long time series of data, and smoothing or other constraints to provide useful estimates. We developed general models for possibly unstable populations that combine time series of age-structure data with other demographic data to provide explicit maximum likelihood estimators of age-specific survival rates with as few as two years of data. As an example, we applied these methods to estimate survival rates for female bison (Bison bison) in Yellowstone National Park, USA. This approach provides a simple tool for monitoring survival rates based on age-structure data.},

abstract = {The plight of the marine fisheries is attracting increasing attention as unsustainably high exploitation levels, exacerbated by more extreme climatic conditions, are driving stocks to the point of collapse. The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the safe biological limit since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for biocomplexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered.},

Populations of meiofauna assimilate a mixture of food resources, however, detrital Spartina may be the predominant source of carbon with micro-algae contributing some portion of the assimilated carbon and nitrogen.},

abstract = {Biology, physics and gravity interact to pump organic carbon into the deep sea. The processes of fixation of inorganic carbon in organic matter during photosynthesis, its transformation by foodweb processes (trophodynamics), physical mixing, transport and gravitational settling are referred to collectively as the “biological pump” (Figure 1). When the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS) began in 1984 in the U.S., followed in 1987 by the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), several ideas about the functioning of the biological pump formed the conceptual core of the fledgling program: ◆ The biological and physical processes in the ocean that control the air-sea carbon dioxide (CO2) balance are key factors in the planetary climate system. ◆ The efficiency of the biological pump, expressed as the amount of carbon exported from the surface layer divided by the total amount produced through photosynthesis, is determined by foodweb processes. ◆ Pump efficiency and export processes can be monitored and understood through a global network of sediment traps and satellite sensors, informed by process studies and models. In this article, we review the antecedents of JGOFS thought on the relationship between biological processes and carbon export and highlight some JGOFS achievements. We then look ahead to suggest where the field is headed and what the major problems are now, after more than a decade of multidisciplinary research in JGOFS.},

abstract = {Simulation models are useful and flexible tools that can be used to synthesize information gained from multiple stock identification methods. The assimilation of information from many sources into a population dynamics model can provide a holistic view of stock structure. Application of spatially explicit models within the simulation framework allows the testing of varying hypotheses regarding stock structure and connectivity. Additionally, using this approach we can examine the ecological, assessment, and management implications of complex spatial structure for the fish resource. This chapter summarizes the simulation modeling framework and how it can be applied to investigate population structure. We highlight how stock identification data can be incorporated into simulations and review recent advances in spatial modeling techniques. We conclude with a discussion of seminal case studies, which illustrate how simulation models have impacted our understanding of stock structure in fish populations. Ultimately, simulation models have many limitations because they are simplified abstractions of large and complex natural systems. However, when carefully vetted and used with strict adherence to the scientific method, simulations can be powerful and invaluable tools for examining spatial population structure. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We first review the numerous models that have been developed for this purpose, and compare them from several standpoints: population modelling, exploitation modelling and management measure modelling. We then present a generic fisheries simulation model, Integration of Spatial Information for FISHeries simulation (ISIS-Fish). This spatially explicit model allows quantitative policy screening for fisheries with mixed-species harvests. It may be used to investigate the effects of combined management scenarios including a variety of policies: total allowable catch (TAC), licenses, gear restrictions, MPA, etc. Fisher's response to management may be accounted for by means of decision rules conditioned on population and exploitation parameters. An application to a simple example illustrates the relevance of this kind of tool for policy screening, particularly in the case of mixed fisheries. Finally, the reviewed models and ISIS-Fish are discussed and confronted in the light of the underlying assumptions and model objectives. In the light of this discussion, we identify desirable features for fisheries simulation models aimed at policy evaluation, and particularly MPA evaluation.},

abstract = {The intensity, duration and frequency of coastal hypoxia (oxygen concentration {\textless}63µM) are increasing due to human alteration of coastal ecosystems and changes in oceanographic conditions due to global warming. Here we provide a concise review of the consequences of coastal hy- poxia for sediment biogeochemistry. Changes in bottom- water oxygen levels have consequences for early diagenetic pathways (more anaerobic at expense of aerobic pathways), the efficiency of re-oxidation of reduced metabolites and the nature, direction and magnitude of sediment-water exchange fluxes. Hypoxia may also lead to more organic matter accu- mulation and burial and the organic matter eventually buried is also of higher quality, i.e. less degraded. Bottom-water oxygen levels also affect the organisms involved in organic matter processing with the contribution of metazoans de- creasing as oxygen levels drop. Hypoxia has a significant effect on benthic animals with the consequences that ecosys- tem functions related to macrofauna such as bio-irrigation and bioturbation are significantly affected by hypoxia as well. Since many microbes and microbial-mediated biogeo- chemical processes depend on animal-induced transport pro- cesses (e.g. re-oxidation of particulate reduced sulphur and denitrification), there are indirect hypoxia effects on biogeo- chemistry via the benthos. Severe long-lasting hypoxia and anoxia may result in the accumulation of reduced compounds in sediments and elimination of macrobenthic communities with the consequences that biogeochemical properties dur- ing trajectories of decreasing and increasing oxygen may be different (hysteresis) with consequences for coastal ecosys- tem dynamics.},

abstract = {Early in the 20th century, Johan Hjort developed compelling arguments and hypotheses to explain recruitment variability that became dominant for more than 75 years. A cautious emergence from Hjorts shadow began late in the 20th century. Hjorts Critical Period hypothesis, i.e., failure of first-feeding larvae to find food, and a second hypothesis, Aberrant Drift of eggs and larvae, were proposed to explain causes of recruitment variability. Tests of the Critical Period hypothesis became an obsession, although support for it was inconsistent and equivocal. Single-minded research on the Critical Period hypothesis gave way to realization that recruitment variability was the outcome of complex trophodynamic and physical processes acting over many temporal and spatial scales and throughout pre-recruit life. A complex mix of main effects and interacting factors can easily generate order-ofmagnitude variability in recruitment via small effects on mortality and growth rates during the abundant egg and larval stages, or via cumulative effects during the pre-recruit juvenile stage. New considerations of compensatory mechanisms that can dampen variability and stabilize recruitment emerged. A little density dependence, especially in the relatively long juvenile stage, can regulate recruitment. Multidisciplinary programs instituted in the 1990s and successful development of statistical models and coupled bio-physical models, offered new insights into mechanisms generating recruitment variability. Despite progress, forecasting recruitment remains a formidable challenge. Solving the recruitment problem is no longer the Holy Grail of fishery science. Appreciating recruitment variability, explaining its probable causes, considering implications for management, and understanding it in the context of broader variability in marine ecosystems, are all worthy goals.},

abstract = {Density-dependent and density-independent processes have been shown to influence the population dynamics of marine invertebrates, especially recruitment. However, their relative importance has not been evaluated in natural populations. High adult densities have been suggested to inhibit recruitment, especially in suspension-feeders which may ingest incoming larvae. Age structure and juvenile abundance were investigated in the bivalve Spisula ovalis in order to evaluate the importance of density dependence in generating spatial patterns. Age structure is readily established in this species owing to annual shell lines. An extensive sample (from about 100 sites a few hundred meters apart over 4 consecutive years) was analyzed in the statistical framework of spatial analyses, avoiding spurious correlations due to non-independence between neighboring sites. The area studied supports about ten annual cohorts, though only a few occur at each site. The overall picture is a mosaic of kilometer-scale patches of contrasted age structures, as revealed by highly significant spatial autocorrelations. To our knowledge, such large-scale spatial patterns in age structure have not previously been described in benthic invertebrates. Strong patterns are detected even for juveniles, and are independent of the adult biomass present before settlement. Therefore, patchy patterns of age structure mainly reflect density-independent effects, such as spatial variations in larval supply, passive transport of juveniles, or predation on recruits. In the absence of detailed spatial analyses: such patterns have been misinterpreted previously as negative effects of adult density on settlement success.},

abstract = {Several harpacticoid copepod species are adapted to an epiphytic lifestyle. Previous studies on tropical seagrass meiofauna mainly focussed on the epiphytic communities and neglected the benthic component. The present study aims to document the benthic harpacticoid copepod communities sampled from different sediment depth horizons adjacent to five seagrass species in the intertidal and subtidal zone of a tropical seagrass bed (Gazi Bay, Kenya). Two benthic copepod communities could be identified mainly based on the tidal position of the samples: a first community was collected near the intertidal seagrasses Halophila ovalis and Halodule wrightii; a second community occurred near the subtidal seagrasses Thalassia hemprichii, Syringodium isoetifolium and Halophila stipulacea. The first community was mainly determined by sediment characteristics (e.g. skewness), while the second community was split off based on organic matter content ({\%} TOM), nutrient and pigment values. A subtle combination of horizontal and vertical niche segregation was reported for the dominant copepod families. Species of the families Thalestridae, Laophontidae and Diosaccidae were structured by tidal position and showed a strong preference for the subtidal zone. The opposite strategy, i.e. a clear preference for the intertidal zone, was found for copepods belonging to the families Paramesochridae and Canuellidae. In addition, Apodopsyllus africanus (Paramesochridae) was well-adapted to stress and was concentrated in the deeper sediment layers near the subtidal seagrasses. On the other hand, Canuellidae, as filter feeders, were concentrated in the upper centimetres of the sediment. The families Ectinosomatidae and Cletodidae did not show any vertical or horizontal segregation. On the species level, however, clear horizontal niche segregation was detected for the family Cletodidae. In addition to the reported ecological results, the study material was used to evaluate different niche definitions. We found tidal position to be the most important factor forcing harpacticoids to specialise. Sediment depth horizon was less powerful in dividing the families into different guilds (from specialists to generalists) based on standardised niche breadth. The present study documents the subtle habitat partitioning of co-existing species in a limited area and its role in sustaining high biodiversity in the community.},

Based on the information about small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) off the coast of China, we simulated a fish population consisting of three subpopulations mixing at intermediate levels, which was considered in the true spatial structure of the population in this study. Three scenarios of population spatial structure were assumed in assessing and managing this simulated fishery: (i) metapopulation, which has the same structure as the true population; (ii) three independent subpopulations, which overlook the exchanges among the subpopulations; and (iii) unit population, which completely ignores the population spatial structure. Corresponding approaches were applied to assess and manage each of these assumed fish populations. The management time period was assumed to be 10 years with two harvesting levels (i.e., maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and f0.1). Assessing and managing the metapopulation as several independent populations could lead to a high probability of overexploitation. Managing the metapopulation as a unit population could lead to local depletion. Use of MSY as a management target may be risk prone in the existence of a metapopulation, and use of a fishing mortality lower than f0.1 as a management target is more desirable.},

The FA recoveries obtained from the aforementioned methods were compared with those of direct transesterification (DT) methods to identify the best extraction methods. The experimental design showed that macroalgal matrix, extraction method, and buffer were key determinants for TL and FA recoveries (P≤0.05), exhibiting significant interactions. But sonication gave erratic results with no interaction with any of the factors investigated. The buffered solvent system of Folch rendered the highest TL yield in U. fasciata and G. corticata while the buffered system of Bligh and Dyer gave the highest yield in S. tenerrimum. DT methods were more convenient and accurate for FA quantification and rendered 1.5-2 times higher yields when compared with the best conventional method, minimizing the use of chlorinated solvents, their cost of analysis, and disposal. The buffered solvent system was found to be the most appropriate for lipid research in macroalgae.},

abstract = {According to conceptual models, the distribution of resources plays a critical role in determining how organisms distribute themselves near habitat edges. These models are frequently used to achieve a mechanistic understanding of edge effects, but because they are based predominantly on correlative studies, there is need for a demonstration of causality, which is best done through experimentation. Using artificial seagrass habitat as an experimental system, we determined a likely mechanism underpinning edge effects in a seagrass fish. To test for edge effects, we measured fish abundance at edges (0-0.5 m) and interiors (0.5-1 m) of two patch configurations: continuous (single, continuous 9-m2 patches) and patchy (four discrete 1-m2 patches within a 9-m2 area). In continuous configurations, pipefish (Stigmatopora argus) were three times more abundant at edges than interiors (positive edge effect), but in patchy configurations there was no difference. The lack of edge effect in patchy configurations might be because patchy seagrass consisted entirely of edge habitat. We then used two approaches to test whether observed edge effects in continuous configurations were caused by increased availability of food at edges. First, we estimated the abundance of the major prey of pipefish, small crustaceans, across continuous seagrass configurations. Crustacean abundances were highest at seagrass edges, where they were 16{\%} greater than in patch interiors. Second, we supplemented interiors of continuous treatment patches with live crustaceans, while control patches were supplemented with seawater. After five hours of supplementation, numbers of pipefish were similar between edges and interiors of treatment patches, while the strong edge effects were maintained in controls. This indicated that fish were moving from patch edges to interiors in response to food supplementation. These approaches strongly suggest that a numerically dominant fish species is more abundant at seagrass edges due to greater food availability, and provide experimental support for the resource distribution model as an explanation for edge effects.},

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that krill (Euphausia pacifica Hansen), which is a centrally important species in coastal-upwelling systems, can survive periods of abnormally high temperatures by shrinkage between molts, even if food is plentiful. In addition, we demonstrate that there is a high amount of individual variation in growth rates of krill.

abstract = {Kelp forests are enormously productive, and they and adjacent habitats support large populations of suspension feeders. What do these suspension feeders eat? Intuitively, we might expect that kelp primary production is a key form of trophic support for these animals. Indeed, a large and growing number of studies using carbon stable isotope data, typically collected over short time periods, have asserted that detritus from kelps is an important, and in some cases the main, food source for coastal benthic suspension feeders. This view has been incorporated into several textbooks and review papers covering kelp forest ecosystems, and loss of trophic support for benthic sus- pension feeders is now often invoked as an ecosystem consequence of top-down or other impacts on kelp forests. More direct evidence, however, suggests that these animals mainly eat phytoplankton and, in some cases, bacteria or zooplankton. Because isotope values of pure coastal phy- toplankton, uncontaminated with detritus, are difficult to obtain, present studies have largely relied on single mea- surements from offshore environments or from the litera- ture, which typically reflects offshore values. We review the evidence showing that phytoplankton isotope values can, and are expected to, vary widely in coastal waters and that inshore phytoplankton may often be enriched in 13C compared to offshore phytoplankton. This unaccounted-for variation may have systematically biased the results of such trophic studies toward finding large contributions of kelp detritus to suspension-feeder diets. We review some key stable isotope studies and put forth evidence for alternative explanations of the isotope patterns presented. Finally, we make recommendations for future isotope studies and describe several approaches for progress in this area. New techniques, particularly flow cytometry and compound-specific stable isotope analysis, provide ways to shed light on this interesting and important ecological issue.},

abstract = {Marine broadcast spawners have two-phase life cycles, with pelagic larvae and benthic adults. Larval supply and settlement link these two phases and are crucial for the persistence of marine populations. Mainly due to the complexity in sampling larval supply accurately, many researchers use settlement as a proxy for larval supply. Larval supply is a constraining variable for settlement because, without larval supply, there is no settlement. Larval supply and settlement may not be well correlated, however, and settlement may not consistently estimate larval supply. This paper explores the argument that larval supply (i.e., larval abundance near settlement sites) may not relate linearly to settlement. We review the relationship between larval supply and settlement, from estimates and biases in larval supply sampling, to non-behavioral and behavioral components, including small-scale hydrodynamics, competency, gregarious behavior, intensification of settlement, lunar periodicity, predation and cannibalism. Physical and structural processes coupled with behavior, such as small-scale hydrodynamics and intensification of settlement, sometimes result in under- or overestimation of larval supply, where it is predicted from a linear relationship with settlement. Although settlement is a function of larval supply, spatial and temporal processes interact with larval behavior to distort the relationship between larval supply and settlement, and when these distortions act consistently in time and space, they cause biased estimates of larval supply from settlement data. Most of the examples discussed here suggest that behavior is the main source of the decoupling between larval supply and settlement because larval behavior affects the vertical distribution of larvae, the response of larvae to hydrodynamics, intensification of settlement, gregariousness, predation and cannibalism. Thus, larval behavior seems to limit broad generalizations on the regulation of settlement by larval supply. Knowledge of the relationship is further hindered by the lack of a well founded theoretical relationship between the two variables. The larval supply-settlement transition may have strong general consequences for population connectivity, since larval supply is a result of larval transport, and settlement constrains recruitment. Thus, measuring larval supply and settlement effectively allows more accurate quantification and understanding of larval transport, recruitment and population connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The influence of mangrove saplings (Avicennia marina) and fiddler crabs (Uca vocans) on carbon, iron, and sulfur biogeochernistry in mangrove sediment was studied using outdoor mesocosms with and without plants (21 m(-2)) and crabs (68 m(-2)). Saplings grew more leaves and pneumatophores in the presence of crabs. Dense microalgal mats lead to two to six times higher benthic production and about two times higher benthic respiration in the absence of crabs. Particle mixing by crabs increased the reactive oxidized iron (Fe(III)) in the upper 2 cm of the sediment, whereas oxygen leaching by roots maintained the deeper rhizosphere oxidized and enriched in Fe(III). The highest microbial activity, measured as carbon dioxide production and iron reduction, occurred within the upper 2 cm of ungrazed sediment and was fueled by the large near-surface biomass of microalgae. Leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from roots stimulated bulk sulfate reduction and caused an upward cascading reduction of the sediment as indicated by low Fe(III) and high Fe(II) between 2-cm and 6-cm depth. The effect DOC was also evident as increased microbial abundance at all depths in the sediment. Fe(III) was the most important electron acceptor for microbial carbon oxidation in ungrazed sediment (63-70{\%}), whereas sulfate reduction was more important in grazed sediment (36-44{\%}), particularly in the presence of plants. Aerobic respiration always accounted for {\textless} 20{\%}. Fiddler crabs and roots of A. marina have complementary effects on the biogeochemistry of mangrove sediment. Their association seems to be mutually beneficial with respect to growth and food availability.},

abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that interactions between antagonistic ecosystem engineers can lead to local competitive exclusion, but disturbance can facilitate broader coexistence. However, few empirical studies have tested the potential for disturbance to mediate competition between engineers. We examined the capacity for disturbance and habitat modification to explain the disjunct distributions of two benthic ecosystem engineers, eelgrass Zostera marina and the burrowing ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis, in two California estuaries. Sediment sampling in eelgrass and ghost shrimp patches revealed that ghost shrimp change benthic biogeochemistry over small scales (centimeters) but not patch scales (meters to tens-of-meters), suggesting a limited capacity for sediment modification to explain species distributions. To determine the relative competitive abilities of engineers, we conducted reciprocal transplantations of ghost shrimp and eelgrass. Local ghost shrimp densities declined rapidly following the addition of eelgrass and transplanted eelgrass expanded laterally into the surrounding ghost shrimp-dominated areas. When transplanted into eelgrass patches, ghost shrimp failed to persist. Ghost shrimp were also displaced from plots with structural mimics of eelgrass rhizomes and roots, suggesting that autogenic habitat modification by eelgrass is an important mechanism determining ghost shrimp distributions. However, ghost shrimp were able to rapidly colonize experimental disturbances to eelgrass patch edges, which are common in shallow estuaries. We conclude that coexistence in this system is maintained by spatiotemporally-asynchronous disturbances and a competition-colonization trade-off: eelgrass is a competitively-superior ecosystem engineer, but benthic disturbances permit the coexistence of ghost shrimp at the landscape scale by modulating the availability of space.},

Le Jolis and Fucus serratus L. All three species had a negative effect on settlement and early recruitment of S. balanoides, densities being significantly lower on settlement tiles beneath the canopy compared to cleared areas. Investigation of the mechanism by which settlement and recruitment were inhibited showed the importance of sweeping of algal fronds at all three shore heights. In addition, we found that the F. serratus canopy inhibited settlement not only by its sweeping action but also by limiting the access of cyprids to the substratum. Detailed examination of the sweeping effect in F. serratus showed that newly settled cyprids transplanted beneath a canopy suffered extremely high mortality (between 82 and 97{\%}) over just one high water period. Mortality was significantly reduced for individuals that had settled within a matrix of adults. Metamorphosis of cyprids to spat conferred no additional resistance to sweeping-induced mortality but resistance increased in 6 day old spat. Mortality in S. balanoides after the end of the settlement season was monitored for three months in experimental treatments and controls. Mortality rates were significantly lower under the canopy than in cleared areas in both the F. spiralis and Ascophyllum zones. The overall influence of each canopy species on the development of barnacle populations on sheltered shores is discussed.},

abstract = {The lack of a common statistical approach describing the distribution and dispersion pattern of marine benthic animals has often hampered the comparability among studies. The purpose of this study is therefore to apply an alternative approach, Taylor's power law, to data on spatial and temporal distribution of 9 dominating benthic invertebrate species from two study areas, the estuaries Odense Fjord and Roskilde Fjord, Denmark. The slope (b) obtained from the power relationship of sample variance (s2) versus mean (??) appears to be species-specific and independent of location and time. It ranges from a low of {\~{}}1 for large-bodied ({\textgreater}1mg AFDW) species (e.g. Marenzelleria viridis, Nereis diversicolor) to a high of 1.6-1.9 for small-bodied ({\textless}1mg AFDW) species (e.g. Pygospio elegans and Tubificoides benedii). Accordingly, b is apparently a valuable species-specific dispersion index based on biological factors such as behavior and intraspecific interactions. Thus, at the examined spatial scale, the more intense intraspecific interactions (e.g. territoriality) cause less aggregated distribution patterns among large- than small-bodied invertebrates. The species-specific interactions seem sufficiently strong to override environmental influences (e.g. water depth and sediment type). The strong linear relationship between the slope b and intercept log(a) from the power relationship is remarkably similar for all surveys providing a common slope of -1.63 with the present sampling approach. We suggest that this relationship is an inherent characteristic of Taylor's power law, and that b as a dispersion index may be biased by e.g. sampling errors when this relationship is weak. The correlation strength between b and log(a) could therefore be envisioned as a data quality check. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stock identification has been an important prerequisite for stock assessment throughout its history. The earliest evaluations of recruitment variability recognized that understanding the spatial scale of a fishery resource is essential for studying population dynamics. A paradigm of stock structure was based on closed migration circuits and geographic variation of phenotypic traits and formed a premise for fishery modeling conventions in the mid-1900s. As genetic techniques developed in the late 1900s, the “stock concept” was refined to include a degree of reproductive isolation. Realization that there was no single method that addressed the various assumptions of stock assessment and needs of fishery management prompted a more holistic view of population structure that called for multiple sources of demographic and genetic data. Recent applications of advanced techniques challenge the traditional view of populations as geographically distinct units with homogeneous vital rates and isolation from adjacent resources. More complex concepts such as metapopulations and “contingent theory” may be more applicable to many fishery resources with sympatric population structure. These more complex patterns of population structure have been incorporated into some advanced stock assessment techniques and metapopulation models that account for movement among areas and sympatric heterogeneity. Wider application of spatially explicit models in future stock assessments will require clear identification of stock components, evaluating movement rates and determining the degree of reproductive isolation. Because spatial structure affects how populations respond to fisheries, incorporation of heterogeneous patterns and movement in stock assessment models should improve advice for fishery management.},

abstract = {Plant-animal-microbe associations are common in coastal marine sedimentary environ-ments. A review of the literature suggests that many of these interactions involve the creation of structures and subsequent alteration of the physical and biogeochemical environment, and represent examples of ecosystem engineering. We consider three common nearshore plant systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses) for which plant-animal interactions have been documented and evaluate them in the context of their structural modifications, the attendant biogeochemical significance, and the extent to which positive and negative interactions dominate. We argue that the strength of observed interactions appears to vary substantially both within and among systems, due to spatial and temporal variance in physical and biotic processes and nonadditive relationships between macroorganisms and microbially mediated biogeochemistry. These conclusions, however, are tentative, as the role of microbial population dynamics and metabolic processes remains poorly under-stood. Several studies suggest that a fuller understanding of microbiological processes may provide the mechanistic underpinnings of plant-animal-microbial consortia, and how they impact productivity and system function on local and broad scales. We suggest that strong linkages between community composition and ecosystem function are attained in highly developed plant-animal-microbe associations and suggest an alternative framework for evaluating the strength and ecosystem-level effects of such consortia. Tests of these interactions, and their relationship to biodiversity and landscape-scale processes, should provide fertile ground for future research.},

abstract = {1. An assumed constant trophic fractionation of 15N/ 14N between consumer and diet (usually 3.4{\^{a}}€° for diet-muscle tissue differences) allows inferences to be made about feeding interactions and trophic level in food web studies. However, considerable variability surrounds this constant, which may conceal subtle differences about the trophodynamics of consumers. 2. The feeding ecologies of herbivores and carnivores differ in terms of diet quality (in C : N terms) and food processing mechanisms, which may affect fractionation. 3. We present a new model that explores how consumer feeding rates, excretion rates and diet quality determine the 15N/14N ratios in the consumer's tissues and hence influence the magnitude of trophic fractionation. 4. Three herbivorous reef fish Acanthurus sohal, Zebrasoma xanthurum and Pomacentrus arabicus were chosen as study organisms. Empirical estimates of diet-tissue stable isotope fractionation were made in the field, and model parameters were derived from feeding observations and literature data. 5. The trophic fractionation values of A. sohal, Z. xanthurum and P. arabicus were 4.69, 4.47 and 5.25, respectively, by empirical measurement, and 4.41, 4.30 and 5.68, respectively, by model, indicating that herbivores have a higher trophic fractionation than the currently accepted value of 3.4. 6. The model was most sensitive to the excretion rate, which may differ between herbivores and carnivorous animals. This model is the first to determine stable isotope signatures of a consumer's diet mixture without applying a constant fractionation value. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

Techniques range from simple, qualitative inferences based on the isotopic niche, to Bayesian mixing models that can be used to characterize food-web structure at multiple hierarchical levels. We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in isotopic space reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level? For each general question, we detail different approaches that have been applied, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. We conclude with a set of suggestions that transcend individual analytical approaches, and provide guidance for future applications in the field.},

@article{Hickey2003,
abstract = {Ocean processes are generally large scale on the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast; this is true of both seasonal variations and event-scale upwelling-downwelling fluctuations, which are highly energetic. Coastal upwelling supplies most of the macronutrients available for production, although the intensity of upwelling-favorable wind forcing increases southward while primary production and chlorophyll are higher in the north, off the Washington coast. This discrepancy could be related to several mesoscale features: the wider, more gently sloping shelf to the north, the existence of numerous submarine canyons to the north, the availability of Columbia River plume water and sediment north of the river mouth, and the existence of a semi-permanent eddy offshore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We suggest that these features have important effects on the magnitude and timing of macronutrient or micronutrient delivery to the plankton. These features are potentially important as well to transport pathways and residence times of planktonic larvae and to the development of harmful algal blooms. The coastal plain estuaries, with the exception of the Columbia River, are relatively small, with large tidal forcing and highly seasonal direct river inputs that are low to negligible during the growing season. Primary production in these estuaries is likely controlled not by river-driven stratification but by coastal upwelling and exchange with the ocean. Both baroclinic mechanisms (the gravitational circulation) and barotropic ones (lateral stirring by tide and, possibly, wind) contribute to this exchange. Because estuarine hydrography and ecology are so dominated by ocean signals, the coastal estuaries, like the coastal ocean, are largely synchronous on seasonal and event time scales, though intrusions of the Columbia River plume can cause strong asymmetries between Washington and Oregon estuaries especially during spring downwelling conditions. Water property correlation increases between spring and summer as wind forcing becomes more spatially coherent along the coast. Estuarine habitat is structured not only by large scale forcing but also by fine scale processes in the extensive intertidal zone, such as by solar heating or differential advection by tidal currents.},

abstract = {Changes in biomass, growth form and shoot net primary production in an eelgrass, Zostera marina L., bed were monitored along transects at three tidal heights in Netarts Bay, Oregon, from May 1979 through June 1981. During the growing season, April through October, the mean plastochrone interval was 16.5 d along the low intertidal transect and 11.6 d along the high intertidal transect. The mean export interval was 13.3 d along the low intertidal transect and 11.6 d along the high intertidal transect. The life span of a leaf averaged 48 d along the low intertidal transect and 36 d along the high intertidal transect. Shoot density was positively correlated with mean leaf area index (LAI) until the LAI reached 3.8 to 5.5, above which LAI was negatively correlated with density. The maximum Zostera biomass ranged from 143 (high intertidal transect) to 463 (low intertidal transect) g dry wt / m2 . Maximum values of shoot net production ranged from 4.7 (high intertidal transect) to 13.6 (low intertidal transect) g dry wt / m2 / d. Zostera shoot net production was related to light and to the physical damage to the shoots associated with a rapid accumulation of Enteromorpha biomass in the bay. In addition, patterns of biomass accumulation were related to the duration of water coverage, as determined by both tidal height and local impoundments of water. At all transects, biomass sloughed was equal to at least 50{\%} of the shoot net primary production in that area during that time period; sloughed leaves accounted for 25 to 97{\%} of these losses. An estimate of the total annual net primary production of aboveground Zostera in the bed was 17,500 kg, dry wt (SE=3,080 kg dry wt), which was equivalent to a mean annual rate of 383 g C / m2 (SE=67 g C / m2 )},

abstract = {Behaviour and life-history strategies of zooplankton have evolved in response to seasonal cycles in food availability, predation risk and abiotic conditions. A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migra- tion? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent pro- cesses and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {Density-dependent and density-independent processes have been shown to influence the population dynamics of marine invertebrates, especially recruitment. However, their relative importance has not been evaluated in natural populations. High adult densities have been suggested to inhibit recruitment, especially in suspension-feeders which may ingest incoming larvae. Age structure and juvenile abundance were investigated in the bivalve Spisula ovalis in order to evaluate the importance of density dependence in generating spatial patterns. Age structure is readily established in this species owing to annual shell lines. An extensive sample (from about 100 sites a few hundred meters apart over 4 consecutive years) was analyzed in the statistical framework of spatial analyses, avoiding spurious correlations due to non-independence between neighboring sites. The area studied supports about ten annual cohorts, though only a few occur at each site. The overall picture is a mosaic of kilometer-scale patches of contrasted age structures, as revealed by highly significant spatial autocorrelations. To our knowledge, such large-scale spatial patterns in age structure have not previously been described in benthic invertebrates. Strong patterns are detected even for juveniles, and are independent of the adult biomass present before settlement. Therefore, patchy patterns of age structure mainly reflect density-independent effects, such as spatial variations in larval supply, passive transport of juveniles, or predation on recruits. In the absence of detailed spatial analyses: such patterns have been misinterpreted previously as negative effects of adult density on settlement success.},

abstract = {Variation in the level of settlement and recruitment in the intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was studied using a hierarchical sampling programme. The effect of three spatial scales, 10s of metres (sites), 1000s of metres (shores) and 100s of kilometres (locations), was determined. The largest spatial scale represented the distance between four widely separated locations, Sweden, the Isle of Man, SW Ireland and SW England, covering a large part of the range of S. balanoides in Europe. Temporal variation was determined by comparison between two years, 1997 and 1998. The settlement period of S. balanoides varied in length and timing, being earlier and shorter at the most northerly location, Sweden. The duration of settlement showed little difference among shores within locations, but the pattern of settlement did vary. Estimates of total settlement throughout the settlement period and of recruitment at the end of this period both showed substantial variation among locations which was dependent on the year of study. There was little consistency in the ranking of locations between the two years. Recruitment showed significant variation at the lower spatial scales of shore and site. In addition, examination of variance components showed a high degree of variation between replicates within sites in 1997. There was a significant relationship between settlement and recruitment at three of the four locations. Across all locations variation in settlement explained between 29 and 99{\%} of variation in recruitment. However, locations showed distinct differences in the level of post-settlement survival.},

abstract = {Developments during the past 20 years are reviewed for four aspects of crustacean growth. These are the hormonal control of moulting, the effects of external factors on growth rate, the patterns of growth and the determination of age. Hormonal control. The nature and structure of Moult Inhibiting Hormone has been determined, though the mechanism by which it inhibits crustecdysone production is still unclear. A role in moult control by Crustacean Hyperglycaemic Hormone has been demonstrated, but needs clarification. Methyl farnesoate, a juvenile hormone like substance, occurs in Crustacea: however, a clear function as a juvenile hormone has yet to be shown. External factors. The effect of increased temperature in reducing moult increments is supported by further data. Reduced food supply causes smaller moult increments and longer intermoult periods: the latter effect is generally proportionately greater. A role for CHH in this process is hypothesised. Patterns of growth. Little advance has occurred in understanding the rationale for the diversity of growth patterns. Computer modelling offers promise, but is constrained by lack of data on natural mortality for validation. Determination of age. The basic methods available remain size frequency analysis and tagging programmes. There have been advances in technology and methods of analysis, but no major breakthrough. Novel methods include radionuclide ratios (expensive, complex and give only duration of current intermoult), lipofuschin pigment assay (promising, but needs further validation), and annular structures in the infra-cerebral organ (still very speculative).},

abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that major changes in age structure occur in wild populations of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) and that a substantial fraction of individuals survive to middle age and beyond ({\textgreater} 3-4 weeks). We thus brought reference life tables and deconvolution models to bear on medfly mortality data gathered from a 3-year study of field-captured individuals that were monitored in the laboratory. The average time-to-death of captured females differed between sampling dates by 23.9, 22.7, and 37.0 days in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 field seasons, respectively. These shifts in average times-to-death provided evidence of changes in population age structure. Estimates indicated that middle-aged medflies ({\textgreater} 30 days) were common in the population. A surprise in the study was the extraordinary longevity observed in field-captured medflies. For example, 19 captured females but no reference females survived in the laboratory for 140 days or more, and 6 captured but no reference males survived in the laboratory for 170 days or more. This paper advances the study of aging in the wild by introducing a new method for estimating age structure in insect populations, demonstrating that major changes in age structure occur in field populations of insects, showing that middle-aged individuals are common in the wild, and revealing the extraordinary lifespans of wild-caught individuals due to their early life experience in the field.},

abstract = {Spatial homogeneity is the exception, not the rule, for many marine populations. Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of 'true' population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Interactions between the scale of dispersal and the disturbance regime can lead to radical shifts in the ability of organisms to colonize patches and persist within a landscape. We varied the spatial and temporal rates of disturbance and the connectivity between patches in a model of a patch landscape to illustrate thresholds of community persistence for a marine benthic community. We used model parameters representative of a New Zealand marine biogenic-structured community for which recovery after the cessation of disturbance has been observed within {\~{}}15 yr. Model results suggest functional extinction of these biogenic communities under many disturbance regimes, and homogenization of the landscape to a community dominated by opportunistic species. Dispersal limitation increases in importance for recovery as the disturbance regime strengthens, indicating thresholds in the tolerable disturbance regime based on the dispersal potential of the dominant biogenic species. Limited sensitivity of our model results to different functional forms of the recovery trajectory and colonization neighborhood suggest that these results can be extrapolated to other biogenic structure-dominated communities with recovery rates of a similar order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the scale of the disturbance regime and dispersal processes are fundamentally coupled, and knowing the scales of both processes is imperative when predicting change in the structure and diversity of benthic communities threatened by cumulative change.},

abstract = {Many apparently generalized species are in fact composed of individual specialists that use a small subset of the population's resource distribution. Niche variation is usually established by testing the null hypothesis that individuals draw from a common resource distribution. This approach encourages a publication bias in which negative results are rarely reported, and obscures variation in the degree of individual specialization, limiting our ability to carry out comparative studies of the causes or consequences of niche variation. To facilitate studies of the degree of individual specialization, this paper outlines four quantitative indices of intrapopulation variation in resource use. Traditionally, such variation has been measured by partitioning the population's total niche width into within- and between-individual, sex, or phenotype components. We suggest two alternative measures that quantify the mean resource overlap between an individual and its population, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all four measures. The utility of all indices depends on the quality of the empirical data. If resources are measured in a coarse-grained manner, individuals may falsely appear generalized. Alternatively, specialization may be overestimated by cross-sectional sampling schemes where diet variation can reflect a patchy environment. Isotope ratios, parasites, or diet-morphology correlations can complement cross-sectional data to establish temporal consistency of individual specialization.},

In experiment I, larvae were fed rotifers and Artemia enriched with ICES emulsions with 0, 30 and 50{\%} total n-3 HUFA levels but with the same DHA/EPA ratio of 0.6. In experiment II, larvae were fed different combinations of enriched rotifers and Artemia, in which, rotifers were enriched with emulsions containing 30{\%} total n-3 HUFA, but different DHA/EPA ratio of 0.6, 2 and 4; while Artemia were enriched with the same emulsions, but DHA/EPA ratio of 0.6 and 4. In both experiments, un-enriched rotifers cultured on baker's yeast and newly-hatched Artemia nauplii were used as control diets. Larvae were fed rotifers at zoea 1 and zoea 2 stages; upon reaching zoea 3 stage, Artemia was introduced. Experiment I revealed no significant effect of prey enrichment on the survival of megalopa among treatments, but higher total n-3 HUFA levels significantly enhanced larval development (larval stage index, LSI) and resulted in higher individual dry body weight of megalopa. Furthermore higher dietary n-3 HUFA levels also resulted in better tolerance to salinity stress. Experiment II indicated that at the same total n-3 HUFA level, larvae continuously receiving a low dietary DHA/EPA ratio had significantly lower survival at the megalopa stage and inferior individual body weight at the megalopa stage, but no negative effect was observed on larval development (LSI). The ability to endure salinity stress of zoea 3, zoea 5 and megalopa fed diets with higher DHA/EPA ratio was also improved. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Finite mixture distributions have been used as models throughout the history of modern statistics. A mixture distribution is a compounding of statistical distributions, which arises when sampling from inhomoge- neous populations with a different probability density function in each component. A finite mixture has a finite number of components. The objective of this project is to develop statistical software for estimating the parameters of mixture distributions with grouped data and conditional data. The method we apply is the standard maximum likelihood estimation method. However, estimating the parameters of a mixture distribution is difficult when the components are heavily over- lapped. Macdonald {\&} Pitcher (1979) solved the problem of overparam- eterization by applying constraints on parameters. We develop a package called Rmix for the R statistical computing environment to fit finite mixture distributions, with the functionality of Macdonald's MIX software (1979), but with updated and substan-tially improved numerical methods based on a combination of the EM algorithm and a Newton-type method implemented in the function nlm provided by the R system.

abstract = {Steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship is one of the most uncertain and critical quantities in fishery stock assessment and management. Steepness is defined as the fraction of recruitment from a virgin population obtained when the spawners are at 20{\%} of the virgin level. Steepness directly relates to productivity and yield and is an important element in the calculation of many management reference points. Stock-recruitment relationships have traditionally been estimated from time series of recruitment and spawning biomass, but recently interest has arisen regarding the ability to estimate steepness inside fishery stock assessment models. We evaluated the ability to estimate steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship using simulation analyses for twelve US Pacific Coast fish stocks. A high proportion of steepness estimates from the simulated data and the original data occur at the bounds for steepness and the proportion decreased as the true steepness decreased. The simulation results indicate that, in most cases, steepness was estimated with moderate to low precision and moderate to high bias. The poorly estimated steepness indicates that often there is little information in the data about this quantity. However, reliable estimation is attainable with a good contrast of spawning stock biomass for relatively unproductive stocks when the model is correctly specified. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In all marine benthic environments, organism replacement depends on recruitment limitation, i.e. the impact of both pre- and post-settlement events on the success of recruitment. The relative contribution of pre- versus post-settlement processes in shaping adult populations has been extensively studied. Most analyses concluded that recruitment limitation is a strong determinant of adults' density. The magnitude of its limitation depends on context, varies with species, and can be strongly modified by all the events preceding and following recruitment itself. A comparison of the outcome of recruitment limitation on hard- and soft-bottom communities has often been neglected. The rules governing these two environments, in both the inter- and the subtidal, might be inferred only by comparing and possibly integrating soft- and hard-bottom ecologies. The highly variable situation that larvae face in the water column is followed by the variability linked to local features, influencing, in its turn, larval settlement and juvenile survival (post-settlement period). A better knowledge of these processes will be possible only by focusing on their relative importance in the two environments and with research on the brief but significant time of larval settlement. ?? 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Seawater, settling particles and sediments were sampled in Trinity Bay, a fjord-like bay on the east coast of Newfoundland, to determine the nature and rates of lipid inputs. At the height of the spring bloom, diatom triacylglycerol storage increased in response to lowered nitrate and silicate concentrations. This was followed by increased concentrations of phospholipids which coincided with biomass increases in dinoflagellates and zooplankton. Sediment trap results from 50-100 m show that planktonic lipids appear to be transferred with little alteration through the water column to benthic and demersal food webs. Fluxes are high, especially in spring, and incorporation into the food web seems to be very efficient with little loss through burial in the sediments. Much higher lipid concentrations are seen in sediments closer to shore where terrestrial plants are likely to be an important contributor to the lipids. The sediment trap results also show that the use of poisons can cause an overestimation of fluxes of some acyl lipid classes, while leaching during deployment may cause an underestimation of fluxes of most lipid classes.},

Lipofuscin concentration in the left olfactory lobe cell mass of the brain was measured using image analysis of fluorescence micrographs. Age predictions based on lipofuscin concentration were more accurate and had narrower 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence limits than those derived from the more conventional body size and weight predictors for all age groups tested (180, 300, 420, 780 d). Overall, use of lipofuscin concentration produced a significantly lower (p0.001) mean age-prediction error (16.65{\{}{\%}{\}}) than use of carapace length or body weight (32.45 and 32.3{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively). Carapace length was of little value for prediction of the age of older individuals. Mathematical models defining the relationships between temperature, age and lipofuscin accumulation were derived from laboratory-reared individuals. These models did not describe adequately the course of lipofuscin accumulation in crayfish from the field over the whole lifespan. Field data from three ``known'' year-classes were used to generate simulated size-frequency and lipofuscin concentration-frequency histograms. Year-classes in the lipofuscin concentration frequency-histogram were much more easily distinguished than in the size-frequency histogram. Under field conditions, lipofuscin concentration was a better predictor of chronological age than conventional morphometric measures.},

Size at molting was less variable among individuals, within and between diets, than age. Food quality had significant effects on male sizes at molting and on stage-specific daily growth rates of both sexes; these effects were strongest during late naupliar and all copepodite stages. ?he mixed Cryptomonas- Anabaena diet significantly Slowed development, particularly of copepodite stages. As a consequence of these effects, individuals raised on the mixed diet were smaller and older at maturity. Within a given diet, individual differences explained much, if not most, of the variation exhibited in growth and development. By following growth and development of a large number of individuals throughout their life cycles, we show that individual females produce variable offspring, indicative of a bet-hedging life-history strategy, and that B. triarticulata (like other calanoids) can grow, develop and survive on diets that include 'poor quality' cyanobacteria.},

The rate of oxygen consumption of the shrimp was determined using a YSI oxygen meter. At a constant salinity of 35??? the respiration rate of P. peringueyi increased with an increase in temperature and ranged between 0.260 and 0.982????l O2 mg wwt- 1 h- 1. The Q10 value over the temperature range 15-25????C was estimated at 3.13. At a constant temperature of 15????C the respiration rate of P. peringueyi also increased with an increase in salinity and ranged between 0.231 and 0.860????l O2 mg wwt- 1 h- 1. For combination experiments the absence of any significant difference in the respiration rate of P. peringueyi at the four temperatures over the salinity range 15-35??? suggests that the shrimp is well adapted to inhabiting environments characterised by variations in salinity and temperature such as those encountered within the middle and lower reaches of permanently open estuaries with substantial freshwater inflow. On the other hand, the total mortality of the shrimp recorded at salinities {\textless} 5??? at all four temperatures suggests that the upper distribution of the shrimp may reflect physiological constraints. Similarly, the increase in the respiration rate of the shrimp at the four temperatures at salinities {\textgreater} 35??? suggests that the shrimp may experience osmotic stress in freshwater deprived permanently open and intermittently open estuaries where hypersaline conditions may develop. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Crabs in a pre-molt condition were collected for STE, including the entire size range of the species. Larger crabs remained in the laboratory no more than 14{\^{A}} days; the average time to molt was 5.8{\^{A}} {\^{A}}±{\^{A}} 3.1{\^{A}} days.

Hiatt diagrams did not show sex-specific differences between juveniles of both sexes, but revealed differences between juveniles and adults in each sex as well as between adults of both sexes. The MI decreased gradually with size; this pattern was described with a quadratic model. The IP increased exponentially with size. The presence of regenerating limbs diminished the MI. The abdomen of females reached its final shape and maximum relative width at functional maturity. Growth curves for both sexes were calculated using the von Bertalanffy model, but this model yielded an underestimation of the actual maximum size of this crab.},

abstract = {We investigate several approaches to estimate natural mortality (M) for summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus. Historically, a value of 0.2y-1 has been used for all ages and both males and females in stock assessments. Recently, M has been increased to 0.3y-1 for males. A range of estimates of M are available from the different approaches. Methods based on maximum age are not appropriate due to exploitation history and the sampling design used to collect age data and estimates of M from relationships with life history parameters are too imprecise to be useful in the stock assessments. Estimates of M from other species are variable and many are unreliable. Modeling higher M for young individuals may be appropriate given the substantial number of 0-year old individuals caught in the fisheries and surveys. Methods based on M being inversely proportional to size may provide a useful age-structured M for young individuals, but the absolute level still needs to be estimated to scale the age-based curve. Simulation analysis suggests that, given the model assumptions and the type of data available, the stock assessment model is able to estimate both female and male M with moderate precision, but with some bias depending on the true values of M. The estimates of M from the assessment were 0.29 (0.23-0.34)y-1 and 0.54 (0.49-0.59)y-1 for females and males, respectively, which are considerably higher than the values used in the current assessment. However, these estimates are sensitive to model assumptions. The estimates of M for males are consistently higher than those for females. A well designed and implemented tagging program where the tagging data are integrated into the stock assessment may be the best approach to produce reliable estimates of M for summer flounder. In the meantime, estimating sex-specific M within the stock assessment model appears to be the most appropriate approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A basic step in understanding the dynamics of a fish population is to quantify movement and mortality rates. Conventional mark–recapture experiments have provided the foundation for studies on animal movement, particularly for fish. Previous studies have shown rapid mixing of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) among fishery regulatory areas, with the pattern of movement related to fish size. Over 300 000 tag releases in Alaska and over 27 000 tag recoveries from 1979 to 2009 were analyzed. We used a Markov model to quantify annual movement probabilities among areas for three size groups of sablefish. The negative-binomial likelihood was used to model the tag-recovery data because of significant overdispersion. Annual move- ment probabilities were high, ranging from 10{\%} to 88{\%} depending on area of occupancy at each time step and size group. Overall, movement probabilities were very different between areas of occupancy and moderately different between size groups. Esti- mated annual movement of small sablefish from the central Gulf of Alaska had the reverse pattern of a previous study, with 29{\%} moving westward and 39{\%} moving eastward. Movement probabilities also varied annually, with decreasing movement until the late 1990s and increasing movement until 2009. Year-specific magnitude in movement probability of large fish was highly negatively correlated with female spawning biomass estimates from the federal stock assessment. Mean mortality estimates from time at liberty were similar to the federal stock assessment. Incorporating these tag-recovery and movement data into a fully age-structured spatial stock assessment model will inform harvest apportionment strategies to conserve spawning biomass and maximize future yields.},

These approaches record only what is consumed rather than what is assimilated by the jellyfish, only provide evidence of recent feeding, and unless digestion rates of different prey are known, may provide biased estimates of the relative importance of different prey to jellyfish diets. Biochemical tracers, such as stable isotopes and fatty acids, offer several advantages because they differentiate between what is assimilated and what is simply ingested, they provide an analysis of diet that is integrated over time, and may be useful for identifying contributions from sources (e.g., bacteria) that cannot be achieved using gut content approaches. Stable isotope analysis has become more rigorous through recent advances that provide: (1) signature determination of microscopic organisms such as microalgae, (2) analysis of dissolved organic carbon, and (3) improved quantification of relative source contributions. The limitation that natural tracer techniques require different dietary sources to have unique signatures can potentially be overcome using pulse-chase isotope enrichment experiments. Trophic studies of gelatinous zooplankton would benefit by integrating several approaches. For example, gut content analyses may be used to identify potential dietary sources. Stable isotopes could then be used to determine which sources are assimilated and modeling could be used to quantify the contribution of different sources to the diet. Analysis of fatty acid profiles could be used to identify contributions of bacterioplankton to the diet and, potentially, to provide an alternative means of identifying dietary sources in situations where the isotopic signatures of different potential dietary sources overlap. In this review, we outline the application, advantages, and limitations of gut content analyses and stable isotope and fatty acid tracer techniques and discuss the benefits of using an integrated approach toward studies of the trophic ecology of gelatinous zooplankton.},

abstract = {The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater proportion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelaglc and benthic aquatlc consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources available in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had 613C values of -29 to -21'L and 634S values of about 8?L, whlch indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had 613C values of -23 to -15'k and 634S values of 5 to 154., resembling a mixture of Spal-tina spp., benthic m{\~{}}croalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic consumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources for the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced In the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, consumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where its availability is the highest. Third, benthic and pelagic organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.},

abstract = {Estuaries are biogeochemical hot spots because they receive large inputs of nutrients and organic carbon from land and oceans to support high rates of metabolism and primary production. We synthesize published rates of annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP) in marine ecosystems influenced by connectivity to land - estuaries, bays, lagoons, fjords and inland seas. Review of the scientific literature produced a compilation of 1148 values of APPP derived from monthly incubation assays to measure carbon assimilation or oxygen production. The median value of median APPP measurements in 131 ecosystems is 185 and the mean is 252 g C m-2 yr-1, but the range is large: from -105 (net pelagic production in the Scheldt Estuary) to 1890 g C mg-2 yr-1 (net phytoplankton production in Tamagawa Estuary). APPP varies up to 10-fold within ecosystems and 5-fold from year to year (but we only found eight APPP series longer than a decade so our knowledge of decadal-scale variability is limited). We use studies of individual places to build a conceptual model that integrates the mechanisms generating this large variability: nutrient supply, light limitation by turbidity, grazing by consumers, and physical processes (river inflow, ocean exchange, and inputs of heat, light and wind energy). We consider method as another source of variability because the compilation includes values derived from widely differing protocols. A simulation model shows that different methods reported in the literature can yield up to 3-fold variability depending on incubation protocols and methods for integrating measured rates over time and depth. Although attempts have been made to upscale measures of estuarine-coastal APPP, the empirical record is inadequate for yielding reliable global estimates. The record is deficient in three ways. First, it is highly biased by the large number of measurements made in northern Europe (particularly the Baltic region) and North America. Of the 1148 reported values of APPP, 958 come from sites between 30 and 60° N; we found only 36 for sites south of 20° N. Second, of the 131 ecosystems where APPP has been reported, 37{\%} are based on measurements at only one location during 1 year. The accuracy of these values is unknown but probably low, given the large interannual and spatial variability within ecosystems. Finally, global assessments are confounded by measurements that are not intercomparable because they were made with different methods. Phytoplankton primary production along the continental margins is tightly linked to variability of water quality, biogeochemical processes including ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange, and production at higher trophic levels including species we harvest as food. The empirical record has deficiencies that preclude reliable global assessment of this key Earth system process. We face two grand challenges to resolve these deficiencies: (1) organize and fund an international effort to use a common method and measure APPP regularly across a network of coastal sites that are globally representative and sustained over time, and (2) integrate data into a unifying model to explain the wide range of variability across ecosystems and to project responses of APPP to regional manifestations of global change as it continues to unfold. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {Mud crabs of the genus Scylla are commercially important mangrove residents that are extensively fished throughout their range in the Indo-West Pacific. Despite this high level of exploitation very little is known about the population dynamics of any of the Scylla species. The present study concentrated on an exploited population of Scylla paramamosain in a natural estuarine mangrove on Can Coc Island in the mouth of the Hau River, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. A total of 6,114 juvenile crabs captured on the seaward mangrove fringe were internally tagged by injection of coded microwire tags and released over a period of 29 days. Recaptures were monitored over the following 144 days. There was little migratory movement within the estuary; of 285 recaptured crabs, 93{\%} were recovered within the island mangrove study area and only two individuals were recovered from mangroves lining the opposite mainland riverbanks. A von Bertalanffy growth function was fitted to growth increment data from recaptured crabs, with L max = 150 mm to derive a growth constant, k = 2.39 year−1. The theoretical age at which carapace width is zero (t 0) was derived from known size at recruitment at instar 1, giving a value of −0.0095 years. Previous studies of the same population have shown that female S. paramamosain reach maturity at a mean size of 102 mm carapace width. The present study indicates that they attain this size at around 160 days from first settlement in the mangrove fringe. Abundance of juvenile crabs in the study area was estimated by the Petersen method as 1,101,500 (95{\%} CI 4,17,300–1,785,800, representing 1,102 crabs ha−1 of mangrove. Estimation of mortality from tag returns and from the age-catch curves during a period of constant recruitment were comparable (Z = 1.11 and 1.04 month−1, respectively). Fishing only accounted for 14{\%} of total mortality, suggesting that at the time exploitation was not at a critical level despite the apparent high level of fishing activity.},

abstract = {Based on previous work, dome-shaped fishery selectivity patterns are expected in place of asymptotic patterns when one-way fish movements among areas are considered. It is less clear if this occurs when the “round-trip” seasonal movements are considered. A simulation of a long-distance migrating fish stock (Atlantic menhaden) was used to study the influence of life history and fishery processes on selectivity, under an “areas as fleet” stock assessment context. When age-constant two-way migration was assumed to occur at a low rate, a domed selectivity pattern in the area ex-periencing the highest fishing mortality was produced, consistent with previous work. However, as the two-way migration rate increased, the domed selectivity pattern diminished and eventually disappeared. When age-varying migration was introduced, with a higher movement prob-ability for older fish, domed selectivity prevailed in the source (i.e. spawning) area. If movement away from the spawning area occurs at younger ages than are selected by the fishing gear, the extent of the dome in this area is reduced. When movement away from the spawning area occurs at ages that are already available to the fishing gear, the dome in the spawning area is exaggerated. The area in which domed selectivity occurred was primarily determined by whether the probability of movement increased or decreased with age. In contrast to previous work that considered one-way or diffusive movement, the temporal or spatial distribution of recruitment and overall fishing mortality did not have a signifi-cant influence on selectivity. Building simulations that reflect the life history of the stock can guide assessment efforts by placing priors and con-straints on model fits to selectivity patterns and be used to explore trade-offs between model complexity and the ability to produce reasonable management advice. Their development is encouraged as a standard feature in the assessment of migratory fish stocks.},

abstract = {Stock assessments commonly allow parameters to vary across fishery or jurisdictional boundaries, often by treating each region as a unit stock. However, animals generally disperse in response to spatial habitat features to satisfy particular life history requirements, and these features are often not congruent with fishery or jurisdictional boundaries. Thus, populations are often spatially structured at scales distinct from those acknowledged in assessments. Furthermore, when the spatial structure arises from dispersal of a common pool of recruits, redefining unit stock boundaries may not adequately capture these dynamics. Here we test the utility of spatially referencing parameters (vulnerability and catchability) in a statistical catch-at-age stock assessment model as a simple approach to account for life history variation of walleye (Sander vitreus) when information on explicit movement rates is unavailable. We apply several alternative assessment models to Lake Erie walleye - a population identified as displaying age-specific differences in the extent of dispersal from spawning grounds - to investigate the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity at ecologically important scales in stock assessments. Comparisons of the most parsimonious assessment models (based on a deviance information criterion) with and without spatially referenced parameters (by basin) highlighted the importance of estimating regional vulnerability and catchability. There was strong statistical evidence that incorporating spatially referenced parameters at a scale relevant to walleye dispersal patterns improved model fit, and the change altered estimates of stock size and fishing mortality. For example, estimates of total age-2 and older walleye abundance in the most recent year decreased by 16{\%} (34{\%} for ages 7 and older) and fully selected fishing mortality increased by 70{\%} after incorporating walleye spatial population structure. These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial aspects in stock assessments at scales relevant to the life history of the species or group of species under consideration. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cold-water corals (CWC) can form complex three-dimensional structures that can support a diverse macro- and megafaunal community. These reef structures provide important biogenic habitats that can act as refuge, feeding, spawning and nursery areas for fish. However, quantitative data assessing the linkage between CWC and fish are scarce. The North Atlantic Ocean is a key region in the worldwide distribution of Lophelia pertusa, which is thought to be the most widespread frame-work forming cold-water coral species in the world. This study examined the relationship between fish and CWC reefs in the northeast Atlantic Ocean by means of video and remotely sensed data from three different CWC communities (Rockall Bank, Hatton Bank and the Belgica Mound Province). Using a tethered camera system, 37 transects were recorded during a period of 8 years. Fish-coral association was investigated using a generalised linear modelling (GLM) approach. Overall, Lepidion eques was the most abundant fish species present (143ind.ha-1). Other common species were Sigmops bathyphilus (17ind.ha-1), Synaphobranchus kaupii (15ind.ha-1), Helicolenus dactylopterus (16ind.ha-1) and Mora moro (7ind.ha-1). The highest fish biomass was measured for Lophius piscatorius (26.3kgha-1). Other species with a high biomass were Helicolenus dactylopterus (4.3kgha-1), Lepidion eques (13.2kgha-1) and Mora moro (7.8kgha-1). Overall, no significant difference in fish abundance and biomass was found at coral framework habitats compared to non-coral areas. The relationship between fish and coral framework varied among fish species and study site. Fish count and length modelling results showed that terrain variables explain a small proportion of the variation of our data. Depth, coral-framework and terrain rugosity were generally the most important explanatory variables, but this varied with species and study site. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, and white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, are frequent inhabitants of coastal estuaries from northern California, USA to British Columbia, Canada. An analysis of stomach contents from 95 green sturgeon and six white sturgeon commercially landed in Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, and the Columbia River estuary during 2000-2005 revealed that 17-97{\%} had empty stomachs, but those fish with items in their guts fed predominantly on benthic prey items and fish. Burrowing thalassinid shrimp (mostly Neotrypaea californiensis) were important food items for both white and especially for green sturgeon taken in Willapa Bay, Washington during summer 2003, where they represented 51{\%} of the biomass ingested (84.9{\%} IRI). Small pits observed in intertidal areas dominated by these shrimp, are likely made by these sturgeon and we present evidence from exclusion studies and field observation that the predator making the pits can have a significant cumulative negative effect on burrowing shrimp density. These burrowing shrimp present a threat to the aquaculture industry in Washington State due to their ability to de-stabilize the substrate on which shellfish are grown. Despite an active burrowing shrimp control program in these estuaries, it seems unlikely that current burrowing shrimp abundance and availability as food is a limiting factor for threatened green sturgeon stocks. However, these large predators may have performed an important top down control function on shrimp populations in the past when they were more abundant.},

Chl a and total fatty-acid contents were not related to cell volume. Fatty acids were four to six times more abundant than Chl a in most species. Relative concentrations of intact lipids were determined for each species using latroscan thin-layer chromatography-fiame-ionisation detection. Polar lipids predominated in all species but triacyglycerols were abundant only in Chaetoceros gracilis, Isochrysis sp. and Chroomonas sp. Free fatty acids were particularly abundant in the two Chaetoceros species. The importance of these data for determining the nutritional value of the microalgae as food for animals in mariculture is discussed.},

abstract = {Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N) compositions were measured for surface sediments, three sediment vibrocores, plants, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary. The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low $\delta$13C of the plants (-28.1‰) is reflected by a sediment $\delta$13C (-24.7‰) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4‰ and -23.0‰, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment $\delta$15N composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, $\delta$15N values of the high marsh surface sediments show 15N enrichment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Total lipid and total FA in the fresh (green and yellow) and decomposing leaves of both species were significantly higher during winter than summer. During decomposition, total lipid content and FA concentration, in particular branched chain fatty acids (BrFAs) and bacterial fatty acids (BFAs), increased to a maximum concentration in 45 days during winter and in 17 days during summer. Lipids were lost faster in K. candel leaf detritus than in B. gymnorrhiza leaf detritus in which {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the total lipid original weight was lost during the summer experiment and {\textless} 60{\%} during the winter experiment. The changes in the concentrations of total lipids and FAs in the decomposing leaves also indicate that mangrove leaves are significant sources of fatty acids and probably other lipid compounds to estuarine ecosystems and that tidal waters transport the lipids and FAs adsorbed to particulate matter from mangroves to adjacent estuarine sediments and the ocean.},

abstract = {Three species of the estuarine amphipod genus Corophium employed oscillatory motions of the maxillipeds and maxillipedal palps to ingest selected particles and pass rejected particles anteriorly from the buccal mass. These species demonstrated strong, mechanical, post-capture selection for smaller particles over the size range of 5-53 @cm (diameter) in both suspension- and surface-deposit-feeding modes. The logarithm of particle probability of ingestion was linearly related to particle diameter. Selectivity was unaffected by the presence of other experimental particles or ambient sediment grain size, but apparently increased with experimental particle abundance and time available for feeding. Corophium ingested 9-pm particles at a rate {\textgreater} 20's - I. Predictions from a setal brush model of selection are consistent with these Corophium data. Similarities in mouthpart movements and setal morphology suggest a post-capture sorting mechanism like that of Corophium may exist in a wide variety of crustaceans.},

abstract = {Stable isotope enrichment experiments offer a potentially powerful way to examine the base of aquatic food webs, but interpretation of the data from these experiments may be confounded by prob- lemssuchasselective ingestion/assimilation of bulk food sources by consumers, variable tracer enrichment over time, and the failure of consumers to approach isotopic equilibrium with the tracer in their diets over the course of the experiment. Our study examined data from a stable isotope addition experiment in which 15 N-labeled NH4 ? wasadded to a midwestern US stream. A compartment model was used to provide insights into the kinetics of 15 N uptake and release from algae, heterotrophic microbes colonizing detritus, and invertebrate consumers. Themodel accounted for temporal variation in the degree of isotopic enrichment and did not require the assumption of isotopic equilibrium between consumers and theirdiets. The importance of instream production (i.e., growth of algae and microbes within the study reach during theexperiment) relative to allochthonous and upstream inputs was ?38 to 50{\%} for heptageniids and Psephenus,10to20{\%} for Orconectes propinquus, Gammarus,hydropsychids, and larval Stenelmis,and ?10{\%} for the filter-feeding Similium and the unionid mussel Pleurobema sintoxia.The alternative choices of algae or heterotrophic microbes as the basis of consumer diets made little difference in these estimates, even though the microbes became more 15 N-enriched than the algae because microbes had higher turnover rates. These results were subject to a number of caveats, and guidelines for experimental design are suggested for future studies to help address some of these problems. Key},

The effects of simulated stalks on both rates of fluid transport near the bed and boundary shear stress change profoundly with their numerical density. Patterns of sedimentation in the field and patterns and rates of re- cruitment of several taxa depended strongly on the presence and numerical density of these structures, in agreement with a priori predictions assuming passive (i.e. purely hydrodynamic) dispersal.

abstract = {Cellular degradative processes, which include lysosomal (autophagic) and proteasomal degradation, as well as the activity of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteases, provide for a continuous turnover of damaged and obsolete biomolecules and organelles. Inherent insufficiency of these degradative processes results in progressive accumulation within long-lived postmitotic cells of biological “garbage” (“waste” material), such as indigestible protein aggregates, defective mitochondria, and lipofuscin (age pigment), an intralysosomal, polymeric, undegradable material. Intracellular “garbage” is neither completely catabolized, nor exocytosed to any considerable extent. Heavy lipofuscin loading of lysosomes, typical of old age, seems to pronouncedly decrease autophagic potential. As postulated in the mitochondrial–lysosomal axis theory of aging, this occurs on account of the transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes rather than to active lysosomes/late endosomes, making the enzyme content of autophagolysosomes insufficient for proper degradation. Consequently, the turnover of mitochondria progressively declines, resulting in decreased ATP synthesis and enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species, inducing further mitochondrial damage and additional lipofuscin formation. With advancing age, lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes and defective mitochondria occupy increasingly larger parts of long-lived postmitotic cells, leaving less and less capability for normal turnover and ATP production, finally resulting in cell death.},

Swimming with the surface current might help megalopae to migrate shoreward in the convergence zone over internal waves or Langmuir circulation cells.

abstract = {1. The power-law dependence of metabolic rate on body mass has major implications at every level of ecological organization. However, the overwhelming majority of studies examining this relationship have used basal or resting metabolic rates, and/or have used data consisting of species-averaged masses and metabolic rates. Field metabolic rates are more ecologically relevant and are probably more directly subject to natural selection than basal rates. Individual rates might be more important than species-average rates in determining the outcome of ecological interactions, and hence selection. 2. We here provide the first comprehensive database of published field metabolic rates and body masses of individual birds and mammals, containing measurements of 1498 animals of 133 species in 28 orders. We used linear mixed-effects models to answer questions about the body mass scaling of metabolic rate and its taxonomic universality/heterogeneity that have become classic areas of controversy. Our statistical approach allows mean scaling exponents and taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling to be analysed in a unified way while simultaneously accounting for nonindependence in the data due to shared evolutionary history of related species. 3. The mean power-law scaling exponents of metabolic rate vs. body mass relationships were 0.71 [95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 0.625-0.795] for birds and 0.64 (95{\%} CI 0.564-0.716) for mammals. However, these central tendencies obscured meaningful taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling exponents. The primary taxonomic level at which heterogeneity occurred was the order level. Substantial heterogeneity also occurred at the species level, a fact that cannot be revealed by species-averaged data sets used in prior work. Variability in scaling exponents at both order and species levels was comparable to or exceeded the differences 3/4-2/3 = 1/12 and 0.71-0.64. 4. Results are interpreted in the light of a variety of existing theories. In particular, results are consistent with the heat dissipation theory of Speakman {\&} Kr{\'{o}}l (2010) and provided some support for the metabolic levels boundary hypothesis of Glazier (2010). 5. Our analysis provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the scaling relationship between field metabolic rate and body mass in individual birds and mammals. Our data set is a valuable contribution to those interested in theories of the allometry of metabolic rates.},

abstract = {The use of stable isotopes has recently grown in studies of trophic structure and the recruitment and migration patterns of consumers. This type of analysis allows the flow of organic matter and trophic relationships to be outlined within complex systems. Although multiple stable isotope analysis is useful in distinguishing linkages between sources and consumers, its efficacy is contingent on the isotopic similarity within each source and the distinctiveness of producer isotope values. As part of a study investigating juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) food webs in the Columbia River estuary we examined the isotopic ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N, and $\delta$34S) composition of five prominent primary producers. We sought to examine statistical variability of primary producer isotope values and its effects on differentiation between sources. We found that within-group isotopic variability occurs at different scales, related to the heterogeneous landscape in which producers grow. Aquatic and wetland vascular plants displayed the greatest range in isotopic composition while benthic algae and particulate organic matter were more constrained in their isotope signatures. When examining differences between groups we found that although $\delta$13C was the most variable isotope ratio, it was also the most useful in distinguishing sources, especially benthic producers compared to water column and emergent producers. Signatures of $\delta$15N and $\delta$34S were most useful in differentiating benthic algal and vascular marsh plant groups. Isotopic composition along with chlorophyll and elemental composition was also useful in distinguishing phytoplankton samples from particulate organic matter (POM) samples. The type and extent of isotopic variability revealed by this study will help inform future food web studies using isotopes to characterize trophic linkages in large estuaries such as the Columbia River estuary. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Northwest Scientific Association.},

abstract = {Detailed observation of the movement of individual animals offers the potential to understand spatial population processes as the ultimate consequence of individual behaviour, physiological constraints and fine-scale environmental influences. However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In aquaculture, the availability of highly nutritive and inexpensive live food is a subject of major concern; from this point of view, some harpacticoid copepods (gen. Tigriopus) are suitable, owing to both the ease of finding in nature and their constant reproduction in culture. In order to optimize the production of nauplii in Tigriopusfulvus Fischer (a species cultured for several years in our laboratory and considered because of its high occurrence in rockpools along the Ligurian coast), the influence of diet composition on some reproductive and developmental parameters was analyzed under laboratory controlled conditions. Two series of cultured females born in culture and acclimatized in the laboratory for several weeks ( {\textgreater} 10) were fed with algae (Monochrisis Mm-i) and yeast (Succharomyces cerevisiue), respectively; another series of females born in culture and acclimatized in the laboratory for only one week was fed with yeast. Results show that the diet affected survival and fecundity. Yeast-fed copepods showed better survival (median 71.5 and 75 days) than those fed algae (median 35 days) (P {\textless} 0.01) . A highly significant difference (P {\textless} 0.01) was observed for the reproductive period with a high incidence of infertile females (28.15{\%}) in the series fed M. lutheri. Lower production rate was recorded in yeast-fed (generally less than 4 nauplii per day) than in algaefed (over 5 nauplii per day) specimens; nevertheless, yeast-fed copepods showed a more prolonged production of nauplii in time with a consequent higher nauplii per day global amount. No difference was observed between the differently acclimatized yeast-fed series. Overall, a short reproductive period along with fast production of nauplii was observed in algae-fed T.fiZvus females; on the other hand, a slower production, although more durable and abundant, was recorded in yeast-fed copepods. Both results should be of interest in aquaculture in order to obtain live food for commercial fish and crustaceans culture.},

abstract = {At two intertidal sites (one sandy and one silty, in the Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands), the fate of microphytobenthos was studied through an in situ C-13 pulse-chase experiment. Label was added at the beginning of low tide, and uptake of C-13 by algae was linear during the whole period of tidal exposure (about 27 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the top millimeter at both sites). The C-13 fixed by microphytobenthos was rapidly displaced toward deeper sediment layers (down to 6 cm), in particular at the dynamic, sandy site. The residence times of microphytobenthos with respect to external losses (resuspension and respiration) were about 2.4 and 5.6 d at the sandy and silly stations, respectively. The transfer of carbon from microphytobenthos to benthic consumers was estimated from the appearance of C-13 in bacterial biomarkers, handpicked nematodes, and macrofauna. The incorporation of C-13 into bacterial biomass was quantified by carbon isotope analysis of polar lipid derived fatty acids specific for bacteria. The bacterial polar lipid-derived fatty acids (i14:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, and 18:1 omega 7c) showed rapid, significant transfer from benthic algae to bacteria with maximum labeling after 1 d. Nematodes became enriched after 1 h, and C-13 assimilation increased until day 3. Microphytobenthos carbon entered all heterotrophic components in proportion to heterotrophic biomass distribution (bacteria {\textgreater} macrofauna {\textgreater} meiofauna). Our results indicate a central role for microphytobenthos in moderating carbon flow in coastal sediments.},

@article{Phillips2003,
abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers in environmental studies. One application is to use isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, such as the proportion of various pollution sources in a waste stream. In general, the proportional contributions of n+1 different sources can be uniquely determined by the use of n different isotope system tracers (e.g., delta13C, delta15N, delta18O) with linear mixing models based on mass balance equations. Often, however, the number of potential sources exceeds n+1, which prevents finding a unique solution of source proportions. What can be done in these situations? While no definitive solution exists, we propose a method that is informative in determining bounds for the contributions of each source. In this method, all possible combinations of each source contribution (0-100{\%}) are examined in small increments (e.g., 1{\%}). Combinations that sum to the observed mixture isotopic signatures within a small tolerance (e.g., +/-0.1 per thousand ) are considered to be feasible solutions, from which the frequency and range of potential source contributions can be determined. To avoid misrepresenting the results, users of this procedure should report the distribution of feasible solutions rather than focusing on a single value such as the mean. We applied this method to a variety of environmental studies in which stable isotope tracers were used to quantify the relative magnitude of multiple sources, including (1) plant water use, (2) geochemistry, (3) air pollution, and (4) dietary analysis. This method gives the range of isotopically determined source contributions; additional non-isotopic constraints specific to each study may be used to further restrict this range. The breadth of the isotopically determined ranges depends on the geometry of the mixing space and the similarity of source and mixture isotopic signatures. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated ranges vary only modestly with different choices of source increment and mass balance tolerance parameter values. A computer program (IsoSource) to perform these calculations for user-specified data is available at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

abstract = {Stress often induces metabolically expensive countermeasures. Bivalve shell production is costly and can thus be indirectly impacted by environmental stress. Suboptimal salinity and temperature may constitute stressors that allocate energy away from shell production to cellular processes such as osmoregulation or to the repair of cellular damage. In the course of climate change, water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are predicted to increase, and salinity is predicted to regionally decrease. These shifts may lead to increased stress for temperate marine species adapted to relatively cool water temperatures and high salinity conditions. To better understand the importance of climate change-related stress, we assessed the isolated and interactive effects of salinity and temperature on shell increment (cumulative growth: shell), cellular oxidative stress (accumulation of oxidized lipids and proteins: lipofuscin), instantaneous physiological condition (condition index: CI), and mortality of young Mytilus edulis and Arctica islandica from the western Baltic Sea. Temperature and salinity interactively affected shell increment, lipofuscin accumulation, and mortality of M. edulis as well as shell increment of A. islandica. Shell increment of M. edulis was less affected by hyposalinity than shell increment of A. islandica. In both species the CI decreased and lipofuscin accumulation increased with increasing temperature. Lipofuscin accumulation negatively correlated with shell increment in M. edulis. We conclude that Baltic Sea populations of ecologically relevant bivalve species may experience severe stress by the predicted regional scenario of warming and desalination if evolutionary adaptation does not happen at a similar rate.},

@article{Eckman1996,
abstract = {The majority of marine benthic invertebrates exhibit a complex life cycle that includes separate planktonic larval, and bottom-dwelling juvenile and adult phases. To understand and predict changes in the spatial and temporal distributions, abundances, population growth rate, and population structure of a species with such a complex life cycle, it is necessary to understand the relative importance of the physical, chemical and biological properties and processes that affect individuals within both the planktonic and benthic phases. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary to study both phases within a common, quantitative framework defined in terms of some common currency. This can be done efficiently through construction and evaluation of a population dynamics model that describes the complete life cycle. Two forms that such a model might assume are reviewed: a stage-based, population matrix model, and a model that specifies discrete stages of the population, on the bottom and in the water column, in terms of simultaneous differential equations that may be solved in both space and time. Terms to be incorporated in each type of model can be formulated to describe the critical properties and processes that can affect populations within each stage of the life cycle. For both types of model it is shown how this might be accomplished using an idealized balanomorph barnacle as an example species. The critical properties and processes that affect the planktonic and benthic phases are reviewed. For larvae, these include benthic adult fecundity and fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, mortality, larval behavior, dispersal by currents and turbulence, and larval settlement. It is possible to predict or estimate empirically all of the key terms that should be built into the larval and benthic components of the model. Thus, the challenge of formulating and evaluating a full life cycle model is achievable. Development and evaluation of such a model will be challenging because of the diverse processes which must be considered, and because of the disparities in the spatial and temporal scales appropriate to the benthic and planktonic larval phases. In evaluating model predictions it is critical that sampling schemes be matched to the spatial and temporal scales of model resolution.},

abstract = {Today's surface ocean is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, but increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms--such as corals and some plankton--will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean-carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

abstract = {Stock size of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) in West Greenland waters has been fairly stable from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Thereafter, survey estimates of biomass increased substantially, and the exploitation rate declined slightly in the most recent years. The present analysis was carried out on a spatially disaggregated basis in order to account for the latitudinal differences in bottom temperature and shrimp density. Changes in recruitment and, with a lag of 2 years, in stock biomass were most pronounced in the northern part of its distributional range, while bottom temperature increased in all survey regions since the mid-1990s. Length-at-age was positively correlated with temperature in general, but a trend towards slower growth was observed in areas with the highest stock densities in the most recent years. It is concluded that the moderate increase in temperature above a lower threshold of the optimal range in the northern regions has extended the distributional area that is most favourable for northern shrimp. This, together with a decreasing rate of exploitation and a continuous low predation pressure, resulted in an increase of the stock to a level at which density-dependent effects have become prominent in parts of study area. ?? 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner–recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner–recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life- history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipu- lative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Knowledge of relationships between prey availability and predator performance is the key to using predators as indicators of the state of marine systems and to assessing potential consequences of competition between natural predators and man for common resources. Fluctuations in the abundance of Antarctic krill are believed to have a substantial influence on the reproductive performance of krill-dependent top predator species in the Southern Ocean; few quantifications of such interactions exist. At South Georgia, for 2 years in which acoustic surveys revealed a major difference in krill abundance, we compared diet, provisioning of offspring and breeding success in 4 main predator species (2 penguins, 2 albatrosses, with supporting data from Antarctic fur seal) whose dependence on krill typically ranges from 20 to 90{\%}. The 4-fold difference in krill biomass between 1986 (ca 30 g m(-2)) and 1994 (ca 7 g m(-2)) was accompanied by (1) an 88 to 90{\%} reduction in the mass of krill in predator diets (and some increase in the fish component), (2) greater prey diversity for most species, (3) reduced diet overlap between species and (4) a switch from krill to amphipods in macaroni penguin but no major dietary change in other species. Rates of provisioning of offspring decreased by 90{\%} in gentoo penguin and 40 to 50{\%} in the other 3 species; this was due to reduced meal size in penguins (by 90{\%} in gentoo and 50{\%} in macaroni) and to doubling of foraging trip duration in albatrosses. Breeding success was reduced by 50{\%} in grey-headed albatross (the species least dependent on krill), by 90{\%} in black-browed albatross and gentoo penguin (only 3 to 4{\%} of eggs producing fledged chicks) but by only 10{\%} in macaroni penguin, presumably reflecting its ability to switch to small prey unprofitable for the other species. However, all species (except for black-browed albatross), particularly macaroni penguin, produced fledglings significantly lighter than usual, probably affecting their subsequent survival. Some effects on adult survival could also be inferred. Our results show a coherent, though complex, pattern of within and between species similarities and differences. These mainly reflect the degree of dependence on krill, the feasibility of taking alternative prey and constraints on trip duration and/or meal size imposed by foraging adaptations (especially relating to travel speeds and diving abilities, whereby flightless divers and pelagic foragers differ markedly). The generality of these principles are explored through comparison with other studies, particularly of Shetland seabirds.},

Typically, natural mortality is estimated using indirect methods, such as correlation with measurable life history factors and rarely relies on direct data such as tagging studies. In contemporary stock assessments, natural mortality may be estimated within the model by integrating different types of data into the analysis. We evaluated the estimability of M using simulation analyses based on 12 groundfish stock assessments conducted using Stock Synthesis. The advantages of utilizing this set of peer-reviewed assessment models were that various types of data were used over a wide range of model parameterization. Our results suggest that, in many cases, M is estimable with appropriate data. Profile likelihood analyses suggested that informative length or age composition data is needed to reliably estimate M. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We used a wave tank to study the influence of pore-water flow and diffusive transport on the degradation of labile particular organic matter (POM: Ulva lactuca pieces) embedded in permeable sediment. Pore-water advection, induced by the interaction of the wave-driven oscillatory boundary flow and stationary sediment ripples, reproducibly exposed POM buried in the top 2 cm of the sediment to oxic or anoxic conditions lasting between days and weeks. Planar oxygen optodes together with carbon and nitrogen analyses were used to visualize and quantify the degradation rates. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were up to 18-times higher at locations of the buried POM compared to the surrounding sediment. Elevated OCR were also detected downstream the POM locations. Despite high permeability of the sediment and exposure to oxygenated pore-water flows, suboxic and anoxic sites and suboxic pore-water plumes developed at and downstream of the locations of POM in otherwise oxygenated sediment regions. The carbon loss of the buried U. lactuca discs derived from the OCR measurements was only 4-15{\%} of that measured by the carbon analysis of the recovered pieces, suggesting that the bacterial degradation of POM and the final degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were spatially decoupled by the pore-water flow. Advection can thus enhance the rate of organic matter degradation by efficiently distributing DOM from the hotspots of organic matter mineralization to larger volumes of permeable sediments and associated microbial communities.},

Whittaker from 1949 to 1951 in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon, USA. We found sharp declines in herb cover and richness on both serpentine and diorite soils. Declines were strongest in species of northern biogeographic affinity, species endemic to the region (in serpentine communities only), and species endemic to serpentine soils. Consistent with climatic warming, herb communities have shifted from 1949-1951 to 2007 to more closely resemble communities found on xeric (warm, dry) south-facing slopes. The changes found in the Siskiyou herb flora suggest that biotas rich in narrowly distributed endemics may be particularly susceptible to the effects of a warming climate.},

Lipofuscin was measured using fluorescence image analysis of olfactory lobe sections from 184 juvenile lobsters from coastal nursery reefs at Seven Mile Beach, Western Australia. Modal analysis of a lipofuscin concentration-frequency histogram for this sample suggested the presence of additional age-classes, not apparent in conventional size-frequency distributions but expected to be present from earlier tag-recapture studies. Modal progression suggested a remarkably constant average lipofuscin accumulation rate of 0.31{\%} by volume per year in the wild lobsters, which was supported by blind-trial measurements of lipofuscin in known-age laboratory-reared specimens. Lipofuscin-based age estimates, indicating that most juvenile lobsters are 3-5 years old immediately prior to recruitment to the fishery at 76 mm carapace length, agree with the long-established relationship between puerulus settlement and lobster catch 3-4 years later. Results indicate that the lipofuscin ageing technique will permit independent assessment of current population parameter estimates and be useful for determining sexual and regional differences in these for the western rock lobster.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {  Due to the extensive motility and prolonged reproductive period of the blue   crab Callinectes sapidus, cohorts may mix and be difficult to differentiate.   In such a case, inferences about local   population loss and turnover from changes in relative   abundance may be tenuous: some form of identification other than size is   necessary. We injected coded microwire tags into the musculature of blue   crabs gtoreq 35 mm carapace width and used the Jolly-Seber (J-S)   mark-recapture model to estimate blue crab population size,   loss probability, and recruitment over a 2.5 yr period within a 1 km-2 salt   marsh creek system. A separate J-S analysis on juveniles ltoreq 80 mm, along   with an analysis of the population size structure, enabled   us to infer which blue crab size classes were responsible for the changes in   population size. Juvenile blue crabs 35 to 80 mm were most   common in spring 1985 and from autumn through spring 1986. Their relative   abundance index generally decreased from spring through summer, as larger   juveniles and adults gt 80 mm became more common. Whereas the sex ratio was   close to unity when the smallest juveniles were predominant, the ratio became   heavily biased towards males when the population size   structures shifted toward the larger sizes. Very few juveniles ltoreq 80 mm   recruited to the population in the autumn-spring of 1986-87   compared to the previous spring and autumn periods. Subsequently, the total   population size was lower through the summer of 1987   compared to the prior 2 years. Density peaked in spring 1985 and 1986 (during   peroids of juvenile abundance) at approximately 0.2 ind. m-2, expressed as   the no. of individuals at low tide throughout the entire subtidal area in the   study site. The J-S analysis indicated the existence of time periods when   recruitment and loss occurred concurrently. During many spring and summer   sampling periods in 1985 and 1986, the probability of loss due to emigration   or death was greater than that observed via net changes in the   population size. Loss probability during 0.5 mo intervals in   March through June 1986 varied from 0.04 +- 0.01 SE to 0.40 +- 0.04   (averaging 0.23) during a period of relatively stable   population size of 11700 to 15800 individuals. Because of   confounding recruitment, the realized rates of gross loss were higher than   those discerned from net changes during such time periods. Most of these   dynamics involved the juvenile portion of the   population: we rarely recaptured large adult crabs, which   had a brief residency after attaining adult size. After the adult crabs   emigrated from the study area, a commercial crabber captured as many as 50{\%}   of those which we had tagged. Our integration of the J-S mark-recapture model   with other population analyses provided a more complete   understanding of the population dynamics of   the motile blue crab than has previously been possible. Quantification of   concurrent recruitment and loss may be important in studies of numerous other   estuarine species which have similar life history characteristics.},

Young animals which had been kept on a vitamin E deficient diet for 17 weeks after weaning showed significant accumulations of autofluorescent pigment in uterus, duodenum, and retinal pigment epithelium, but not in the spinal cord or interior olivary nucleus of the brain. Old animals (96 weeks) fed a commercial diet with adequate vitamin E had accumulated lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium, spinal cord gray matter, and inferior olivary nucleus, but not in the duodenum or uterus. Thus, while the autofluorescent pigments related to aging and vitamin E deficiency have similar properties, their tissue distributions are quite different.},

abstract = {Climate change may affect the spatial distribution of fish populations in ways that would affect the accuracy of spatially aggregated age-structured assessment models. To evaluate such scenarios, spatially aggregated models were compared with spatially explicit models using simulations. These scenarios were based on hypothetical climate-driven distribution shifts and reductions in mean recruitment of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the eastern Bering Sea. Results indicate that biomass estimates were reasonably accurate for both types of estimation models and precision improved with the inclusion of tagging data. Bias in some aggregated model scenarios could be attributed to unaccounted-for process errors in annual fishing mortality rates and was reduced when estimating effective sample size or time-varying selectivity. Spatially explicit models that allow estimation of variability in movement and ontogenetic parameters (specified as a random walk process) were shown to be feasible, whereas models that misspecified ontogenetic movement and climate change effects resulted in biased biomass and movement parameter estimates. These results illustrate that more complex models may characterize processes better but may be less robust for management advice. R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}:},

abstract = {Demographic heterogeneity—variation among individuals in survival and reproduction—is ubiquitous in natural populations. Structured population models address heterogeneity due to age, size, or major developmental stages. However, other important sources of demographic heterogeneity, such as genetic variation, spatial heterogeneity in the environment, maternal effects, and differential exposure to stressors, are often not easily measured and hence are modeled as stochasticity. Recent research has elucidated the role of demographic heterogeneity in changing the magnitude of demographic stochasticity in small populations. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized effect: heterogeneous survival in long-lived species can increase the long-term growth rate in populations of any size. We illustrate this result using simple models in which each individual's annual survival rate is independent of age but survival may differ among individuals within a cohort. Similar models, but with nonoverlapping generations, have been extensively studied by demographers, who showed that, because the more ‘‘frail'' individuals are more likely to die at a young age, the average survival rate of the cohort increases with age. Within ecology and evolution, this phenomenon of ‘‘cohort selection'' is increasingly appreciated as a confounding factor in studies of senescence. We show that, when placed in a population model with overlapping generations, this heterogeneity also causes the asymptotic population growth rate k to increase, relative to a homogeneous population with the same mean survival rate at birth. The increase occurs because, even integrating over all the cohorts in the population, the population becomes increasingly dominated by the more robust individuals. The growth rate increases monotonically with the variance in survival rates, and the effect can be substantial, easily doubling the growth rate of slow-growing populations. Correlations between parent and offspring phenotype change the magnitude of the increase in k, but the increase occurs even for negative parent–offspring correlations. The effect of heterogeneity in reproductive rate on k is quite different: growth rate increases with reproductive heterogeneity for positive parent– offspring correlation but decreases for negative parent–offspring correlation. These effects of demographic heterogeneity on k have important implications for population dynamics, population viability analysis, and evolution. Key},

abstract = {We show that ocean fronts set recruitment patterns among both community-building invertebrates and commercially important fishes in nearshore intertidal and rocky reef habitats. Chlorophyll concentration and recruitment of several species of intertidal invertebrates (Balanus spp., Chthamalus spp., Mytilus spp.) and rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are positively correlated with front probability along the coast of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Abundances of recent settlers and adults for nearshore rockfish species are also positively correlated with front probability. The interaction of coastal topography and bathymetry sets spatial scales of fronts and consequently recruitment at approximately 50 km during active upwelling, compared to 200 km or greater during non-upwelling periods. Such relationships between fronts and recruitment are likely to be consistent across other marine ecosystems-from coastal waters to the open ocean-and provide a critical link between adults and widely dispersing young. Ocean fronts, already known as features with high biodiversity and resilience in pelagic habitats, also set recruitment and connectivity patterns across multiple taxa for intertidal and rocky reef communities, thus linking biodiversity and resilience in coastal and benthic habitats as well.},

However, the generality of such interactions is uncertain. The predictions of a mobility-mode functional-group hypothesis are here compared with experimental studies in order to determine its usefulness as a model for community interactions. This hypothesis appears to provide a good predictive framework under limited conditions. Dense aggregations of large organisms or those with strong sedimentary effects may exclude smaller species through modifications related to their mobility type. However, the interactions are asymmetrical. Dense assemblages of smaller species have not been shown to exclude larger forms. These results suggest a re-evaluation of the conditions necessary for mobility-related interactions to become important in regulating the composition of a benthic community. Although the mobility-mode theory describes the influence of active or large members of a tideflat community, care should be taken in assuming such interactions among smaller fauna.},

abstract = {In this study, the contents, sources and accumulation rate of sedimentary organic matter (OM) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and adjacent coastal area were investigated. The stable carbon isotopic composition ($\delta$13C) is a reliable geochemical proxy and was used to indicate the OM origin here. Nevertheless, the organic carbon and nitrogen molar ratios (TOC/TN) and the stable nitrogen isotopic composition ($\delta$15N) were affected by diagenesis and could be the supplementary indicators. The sources of OM were estimated based on the two end-member model. The results showed that in the estuary, sedimentary OM originated from terrestrial and aquatic mixing origins, whereas, OM in coastal sediments was dominantly algae-derived. The accumulation rate of sedimentary OM was analyzed based on 210Pb dating. Due to the sampling sites and the distinct hydraulic environments, the accumulation rates of TOC, aquatic and terrestrial OC were obviously higher in the estuary than in coastal area. TOC accumulation rates were 18–27mgcm−2y−1 in the estuary, and 0.84–3.6mgcm−2y−1 in coastal area. Aquatic OC accumulation rates were 7.9–11.3, 0.8–1.3, and 2.6–3.1mgcm−2y−1, and terrestrial OC accumulation rates were 9.7–16.3, 0.02–0.14, 0.16–0.42mgcm−2y−1 in cores 2, 5, 6, respectively. It could be seen from the high accumulation rate of organic matter in the estuary that, when nutrients increased in the river, phytoplankton biomass and productivity would also have increased. As a result, phytoplankton sinking and organic matter sedimentation usually increased with primary productivity, resulting in the observed accumulation rate of aquatic OC in the estuary. Furthermore, terrestrial OC accumulation rates in the estuary and coastal area showed an increasing trend with the age.},

abstract = {Aim  The study and prediction of species–environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation  We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions  Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.},

abstract = {Estimation of zooplankton mortality rates in field populations is a challenging task that some contend is inherently intractable. This paper examines several of the objections that are commonly raised to efforts to estimate mortality. We find that there are circumstances in the field where it is possible to sequentially sample the same population and to resolve biologically caused mortality, albeit with error. Precision can be improved with sampling directed by knowledge of the physical structure of the water column, combined with adequate sample replication. Intercalibration of sampling methods can make it possible to sample across the life history in a quantitative manner. Rates of development can be constrained by laboratory-based estimates of stage durations from temperature- and food-dependent functions, mesocosm studies of molting rates, or approximation of development rates from growth rates, combined with the vertical distributions of organisms in relation to food and temperature gradients. Careful design of field studies guided by the assumptions of specific estimation models can lead to satisfactory mortality estimates, but model uncertainty also needs to be quantified. We highlight additional issues requiring attention to further advance the field, including the need for linked cooperative studies of the rates and causes of mortality of co-occurring holozooplankton and ichthyoplankton. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotope signatures (delta(15)N) are increasingly used to infer the trophic position of consumers in food web studies. Interpreting the delta(15)N of consumers relative to the delta(15)N characterizing the base of the food web provides a time-integrated measure of trophic position. We use primary consumers (trophic level 2) as baseline indicator organisms and investigate the variation in baseline delta(15)N values in 14 lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Values of delta(15)N ranged from -2 to +9 parts per thousand and varied significantly as a function of lake habitat (mean littoral = 1.6 parts per thousand, pelagic = 3.1 parts per thousand, profundal = 5.2 parts per thousand). Stable carbon isotopic signatures (delta(13)C) Of primary consumers decreased along this same habitat gradient (mean littoral = -23.8 parts per thousand, pelagic = -28.4 parts per thousand, profundal = -30.5 parts per thousand). Primary consumer delta(13)C and a categorical lake variable explained 72{\%} of the variability in primary consumer delta(15)N. This relationship was corroborated by primary consumer delta(15)N and delta(13)C data from the literature, indicating that habitat-specific variation in baseline delta(15)N and delta(13)C is a widespread phenomenon in freshwater systems. We present a method that uses the presented baseline delta(15)N-delta(13)C relationship and the delta(15)N and delta(13)C values of the consumer to estimate trophic position; it is a method that corrects for the described variation in baseline delta(15)N. These results emphasize the general importance of accounting for patterns in isotopic signatures characterizing the base of the food web when inferring trophic structure using stable isotopes},

abstract = {Predation is often described as an underlying mechanism to explain edge effects. We assessed the importance of predation in determining edge effects in seagrass using two approaches: a video survey to sample predators at small scales across seagrass edges, and a tethering experiment to determine if predation was an underlying mechanism causing edge effects. Underwater videos were placed at four positions: middle of seagrass patches; edge of seagrass; sand immediately adjacent to seagrass and sand distant from seagrass. Fish abundances and the time fish spent in view were measured. The main predatory fish (Australian salmon, Arripis spp.) spent more time over adjacent sand than other positions, while potential prey species (King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctata (Cuvier), recruits) were more common in the middle of seagrass patches. Other species, including the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber (Freminville), and King George whiting adults, spent more time over sand adjacent to seagrass than distant sand, which may be related to feeding opportunities. King George whiting recruits and pipefish (Stigmatopora spp.) were tethered at each of the four positions. More whiting recruits were preyed upon at outer than inner seagrass patches, and survival time was greater in the middle of shallow seagrass patches than other positions. Relatively few pipefish were preyed upon, but of those that were, survival time was lower over sand adjacent to seagrass than at the seagrass edge or middle. Video footage revealed that salmon were the dominant predators of both tethered King George whiting recruits and pipefish. The distribution of predators and associated rate of predation can explain edge effects for some species (King George whiting) but other mechanisms, or combinations of mechanisms, are determining edge effects for other species (pipefish). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fatty acid (FA) analysis is a well- established tool for studying trophic interactions in marine habitats. However, its application to benthic food webs poses 2 particular challenges. First, unlike pelagic zooplankton, benthic con- sumers have access to different sizes and func- tional groups of primary producers and may con- sume a highly mixed diet. Classes of benthic primary producers are distinct in their overall FA composition, but most do not possess unique marker FAs that can be used to identify their con- tribution to higher trophic levels. Second, unlike mammalian predators, benthic invertebrates have the capacity to significantly modify their dietary FAs and thereby obscure markers for food sources. Controlled feeding studies have been used to dis- tinguish dietary tracer FAs from those that are modified by the consumer in several benthic invertebrates, but more such studies are needed. Despite these challenges, FAs have been used to study trophic structure in a variety of benthic habitats including the deep sea, polar regions, estuaries, and the rocky subtidal zone. However, the complexity of benthic food webs and lack of unique markers impose uncertainties in the inter- pretation of FA data from field studies. Multivari- ate analyses are necessary for analyzing FA datasets, although univariate tests can be useful for comparing levels of informative FAs among food sources and consumers. Combining FA analysis with other lines of evidence, such as sta- ble isotope analysis, offers a more reliable approach to examining trophic interactions in benthic systems.},

The emphasis is on concepts rather than statistical formulations.  statistical analysis and biological considerations are shown to be complementary rather than contradictory, in that the statistical analysis of a data set depends on the experimental design, that no amount of statistical sophistication can rescue a badly designed study, and that good experimental design is crucial. The traditional null hypothesis significance testing approach has severe limitations, but p values and statistical significance still often seem to be the primary objective of an analysis. Emphasis instead should be on identifying the size of effects that are biologically important and, with the involvement of the "domain" scientist, using these to help design experiments with appropriate sample sizes and statistical power. The issues discussed here are also directly applicable to other areas of research.},

abstract = {During the past decade, regional changes in the dynamics of the Atlanto-Iberian stock of sardine, and its exploitation by Portuguese and Spanish purse-seine fisheries, have increased the uncertainties in estimated trends of spawning biomass, stock abundance, and fishing mortality. Together with recent evidence for lack of discontinuities in the distribution of sardine eggs at the edges of the stock area, this casts doubts on the hypothesis that the stock is a panmictic, closed population. Sardine morphometric data (truss variables and landmark data) from 14 samples spanning the northeastern Atlantic and the western Mediterranean were analysed by multivariate and geometric methods. The analyses explored the homogeneity of sardine shape within the area studied, as well as its relation to that of adjacent and distant populations (Azores and northwestern Mediterranean). Principal components analysis on size-corrected truss variables and cluster analysis of mean fish shape using landmark data indicate that the shape of sardine off southern Iberia and Morocco is distinct from the shape of sardine in the rest of the area. The two groups of sardine are significantly separated by discriminant analysis, and their validity was confirmed by large percentages of correct classifications of test fish (87 and 86{\%} of fish from the test sample were correctly classified into each group, respectively). There was also some evidence that fish from the western Mediterranean and the Azores form a separate morphometric group. These results question both the homogeneity within the Atlanto- Iberian sardine stock and the validity of its current boundaries},

abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17{\%} and 33{\%}, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the "rebuilding quotas") in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.},

The method was validated for five different types of samples; cod liver (high lipid content {\textgreater}60{\%}, mainly triacylglycerol), cod muscle (low lipid content, approximately 1{\%}, mainly phospholipids), cod plasma (lipid content, approximately 2{\%}, mainly lipoprotein complex, high water amount), cod testis (lipid content approximately 3{\%}, high levels of cholesterol), and herring muscle (lipid content approximately 7{\%}). The one-step procedure for extraction/methylation of wet tissues was compared with the traditional procedure of extraction of the lipids by the Folch method (chloroform/methanol, 2:1, v/v), followed by methylation. The two methods gave similar FA profiles. The one-step extraction/methylation procedure gave a higher recovery of the total FA than the traditional procedure. Problems with carry-over peaks of cholesterol from previous samples were avoided by application of extra long GC temperature programs. The cholesterol decomposed to some degree under the preceding methanolysis step, giving several peaks in the chromatograms. The decomposition peaks were identified by mass spectrometry as cholestdienes originating from dehydration of cholesterol, a metylether of cholesterol and a cholesteryl chloride. These cholesterol artefacts can be used for quantitative determination of cholesterol in the samples. Standard samples of cholesterol were determined with high accuracy, (R(2){\textgreater}0.99), and cholesterol in cod plasma was compared with good agreement (R(2)=0.97) to an enzymatic method.},

abstract = {Bayesian mixing model analyses of re - source and consumer stable isotope composition are commonly used to infer elemental, energetic, and trophic pathways in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, the outputs of these models may be biased towards prior or null generalist assumptions, but the magnitude of this potential bias is unknown. I con- ducted a series of experiments to determine how this bias is affected by the geometry and end-member un- certainty of resource polygons. These experiments showed that bias is mostly due to isotopic overlap be- tween resources and is very strongly cor related in a sigmoid manner with the normalized surface area of stable isotope resource polygons. The normalized sur- face area, a classic signal to noise ratio in bivariate space, is calculated by scaling the x and y ordinates by the mean standard deviations (SD) for $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N, respectively. When equilateral 3-resource poly- gons have a surface area {\textless}3.4 SD2, the outputs of Bayesian mixing models primarily reflect the prior generalist assumption. The back-calculated bias for 85 recently published triangular polygons averaged 50 ± 28{\%} (± SD). Analyses of regular resource poly- gons with 4 to 6 resources required 3.1 to 8.0 times larger normalized surface areas to constrain bias. Fur- thermore, polygons with 4 or more resources gave poor outcomes for minor diet components. There was a strong bias for resources similar, and against re- sources dissimilar, to the dominant resource. Overall, Bayesian methods applied to underdetermined mod- els and poorly resolved data very often give results that are highly biased towards centrist and generalist solutions. KEY},

The whales removed an extensive biomass of shrimp from the pits. Ghost shrimp standing stock was 2-5 times lower inside than outside feeding pits, equivalent to a removal of 3-6 kg of shrimp per pt. An estimated 2700-3200 feeding pits were present in 19 km of sand flat in 1990, while 19000 feeding pits were documented over the same region in spring and summer, 1991. We estimated that 10-12 and 75 t of shrimp were removed from the pits in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Ghost shrimp represent an energetically valuable prey for gray whales, providing 2-15 times higher standing stocks than any other reported prey. We discuss our results in the context of conflicts with human activity, impacts on the littoral community, and the significance of an expanding gray whale population.},

abstract = {Net sediment-water interface fluxes of oxygen, dinitrogen, and dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen were determined in shallow, subtidal estuarine sediments (Galveston Bay, Texas) using in situ benthic chamber incubations. Diel variability in the sediment oxygen demand and in the flux of dinitrogen were attributable to the occurrence of benthic photosynthesis. Daytime denitrification rates exceeded nighttime rates. During daytime chamber incubations, small changes in dissolved oxygen concentration were observed. At night, oxygen concentrations decreased, as consumption reactions dominated the oxygen flux. Oxygen production by benthic microalgae enhanced rates of, and coupling between, nitrification and denitrification when ammonium was not limiting, resulting in significant loss of nitrogen from sediments as dinitrogen gas. A transient three box model was used to assess the effect of benthic primary production on sediment nitrogen cycling. Model results demonstrate increased rates of nitrification and denitrification in the presence of benthic photosynthesis and agree well with observed patterns of dissolved dinitrogen- and oxygen-flux data obtained during benthic chamber incubations. When no photosynthesis was permitted during the model runs, rates of nitrification and denitrification decreased significantly. Together, our results suggest that denitrification estimates for shallow estuaries could be underestimated if the influence of benthic primary production on denitrification is not considered.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

abstract = {Lipofuscin accumulation is associated with ageing at the subcellular level. A strong correlation between lipofuscin and age has been found in crustaceans using histological techniques. This association has been proposed as the basis for a methodology to age crustaceans and in some cases lipofuscin levels were found to be better correlated with age than size. The experiment presented here was designed to test the potential effect of diet, in particular dietary antioxidants, on lipofuscin accumulation and age estimation. The shrimp, Penaeus japonicus, was reared in an aquaculture facility and fed commercial pellets with modified vitamins C and E contents. One group was fed with levels of vitamins C and E of 1000 and 150 mg/kg, respectively, and another group with 2500 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. The experiment started when the shrimp were 19 weeks old. Samples were obtained at this point and at ages 33 and 43 weeks. Lipofuscin was measured in the nerve cords (antennal neuropils and oesophageal connectives) in an area adjacent to the brain. Dietary antioxidants significantly affected lipofuscin levels. High vitamin content in the diet resulted in lower percentage of the observed area covered with lipofuscin, lower lipofuscin granule density and lower average granule size. Gender had no effect on any of these variables and granule size did not significantly change within each treatment. Lipofuscin area and granule density increased with age in both vitamin treatments. These results suggest that age estimation using lipofuscin indices may be biased when: (1) wild populations are dispersed over diverse environments; (2) the age estimation of wild individuals is based on the results obtained using laboratory-reared individuals. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

For therapeutical intervention in these antihomeostatic processes, we successively (1972-1992) developed a neurometabolic antioxidative therapy--finally represented by a specific antistress and antiaging synergistic formula, Antagonic-Stress. Its homeostatic actions have been demonstrated in the stressed aging brains by reestablishing the anabolism/catabolism balance: anabolic regeneration by increasing total RNA, total proteins and water-soluble proteins, coupled with catabolic regulation by accelerated lipofuscinolysis and age pigment elimination (neuronal--{\textgreater}glial--{\textgreater}capillary route) and decreasing of water-insoluble proteins. Specific, synergistic, and superior actions of Antagonic-Stress multiple formula vs. antistress and antiaging monotherapy have been demonstrated by preclinical and clinical studies, confirming our results.},

abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of ‘variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

To assess the suitability of macroalgae as a source, 16$\backslash$nspecies (nine Phaeophyceae, five Rhodophyta and two Chlorophyta) were$\backslash$ncollected at two seasons (June and November) from the Irish west Coast,$\backslash$nand total fatty acid contents and specific profiles were determined.$\backslash$nTotal fatty acid contents, expressed per percentage of dry weight,$\backslash$nranged from 6.4 {\%} +/- 0.3 (Pelvetia canaliculata, Phaeophyceae) to 0.8$\backslash$n{\%} +/- 0.2 (Porphyra dioica, Rhodophyta). Most common fatty acids were$\backslash$npalmitic (16:0), oleic (OLE, 18:1 n-9), alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3 n-3),$\backslash$narachidonic (ARA, 20:4 n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 n-3) acids.$\backslash$nFatty acid profiles were highly variable between and within algal$\backslash$ngroups; red and brown seaweeds were generally richer in LC-PUFA (e.g.$\backslash$n20:4 n-6 and 20:5 n-3), while high levels of saturated fatty acids such$\backslash$nas palmitic acid (16:0) were observed in green species. Most omega-3$\backslash$nPUFA-rich species investigated had a omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio$\backslash$nclose to 1, which is favourable for human health.

abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers in environmental studies. One application is to use isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, such as the proportion of various pollution sources in a waste stream. In general, the proportional contributions of n+1 different sources can be uniquely determined by the use of n different isotope system tracers (e.g., delta13C, delta15N, delta18O) with linear mixing models based on mass balance equations. Often, however, the number of potential sources exceeds n+1, which prevents finding a unique solution of source proportions. What can be done in these situations? While no definitive solution exists, we propose a method that is informative in determining bounds for the contributions of each source. In this method, all possible combinations of each source contribution (0-100{\%}) are examined in small increments (e.g., 1{\%}). Combinations that sum to the observed mixture isotopic signatures within a small tolerance (e.g., +/-0.1 per thousand ) are considered to be feasible solutions, from which the frequency and range of potential source contributions can be determined. To avoid misrepresenting the results, users of this procedure should report the distribution of feasible solutions rather than focusing on a single value such as the mean. We applied this method to a variety of environmental studies in which stable isotope tracers were used to quantify the relative magnitude of multiple sources, including (1) plant water use, (2) geochemistry, (3) air pollution, and (4) dietary analysis. This method gives the range of isotopically determined source contributions; additional non-isotopic constraints specific to each study may be used to further restrict this range. The breadth of the isotopically determined ranges depends on the geometry of the mixing space and the similarity of source and mixture isotopic signatures. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated ranges vary only modestly with different choices of source increment and mass balance tolerance parameter values. A computer program (IsoSource) to perform these calculations for user-specified data is available at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

abstract = {The frequently observed positive relationship between fish population abundance and spatial distribution suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan based solely on the SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 demersal populations (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management.},

abstract = {Though not typically regarded as "biomarkers" in the traditional sense of the word, the radioactive and stable isotopes of carbon (14C and 13C, respectively) can serve as powerful tools for identifying sources and estimating turnover times of organic matter in aquatic systems. Paired 14C and 13C measurements of carbon pools can provide an additional degree of specificity for studies of organic matter cycling as a result of: (1) the lower susceptibility of natural isotopes to diagenetic effects that can alter organic biomolecules; (2) the "dual" isotopic nature of the approach; (3) the unique input functions for each isotope; and (4) the greater dynamic range in ??14C (-1000 to ??? + 200???) compared to ??13C (??? -32 to -12???). Relatively few geochemical studies in rivers, estuaries and the coastal ocean waters have employed 14C and 13C analyses of organic matter. In this paper we summarize the available data on 14C and 13C measurements in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) in these systems. A brief review is presented of current methods for the separation and oxidation of DOC and POC from water samples, for subsequent ??14C and ??13C analyses. We also compile the existing datasets on paired 14C and 13C measurements across the riverine to coastal marine continuum in order to elucidate sources, ages, and transformations of organic matter within each system, and during transport from rivers to the coastal ocean. The natural range in the ??14C values of both DOC and POC across similar system types was 500 and 1000??? respectively. In general, riverine DOC was enriched in 14C relative to POC in rivers and estuaries, but the opposite generally held for coastal marine waters. This is indicative of the different sources and transport mechanisms for DOC and POC within and across these three general types of systems. During river and estuarine transport, DOC generally becomes enriched in 13C and depleted in 14C due to simultaneous additions from autochthonous production and removals from heterotrophic bacteria and abiotic processes. Bacterial utilization experiments indicate that bacteria preferentially utilize a 14C enriched (i.e. young) DOC fraction and, therefore, DOC utilization is a partial explanation for the 14C-depeleted riverine and estuarine DOC. It is concluded that through the use of paired 14C and 13C measurements in DOC and POC, a more robust interpretation of sources, sinks, and residence times of organic matter may be attained than by using either isotope separately. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Specialisms on resources and for niches, leading to specialization, have been construed to be tantamount to speciation and vice versa, while the occurrence of true generalism in nature has also been questioned. We argue that generalism in resource use, biotope occupancy, and niche breadth not only exists, but also forms a crucial part in the evolution of specialists, representing a vital force in speciation and a more effective insurance against extinction. We model the part played by generalism and specialism in speciation and illustrate how a balance may be maintained between the number of specialists and generalists within taxa. The balance occurs as an ongoing cycle arising from turnover in the production of specialists and generalists, speciation, and species extinction. The nature of the balance depends on the type of resources exploited, biotopes, and niche space occupied. These vary between different regions and create taxonomic biases towards generalists or specialists. We envisage that the process may be sympatric/parapatric, although it is more likely initiated by allopatry driven by abiotic forces.},

abstract = {A recurring pattern of declining mean trophic level of fisheries landings, termed "fishing down the food web," is thought to be indicative of the serial replacement of high-trophic-level fisheries with less valuable, low-trophic-level fisheries as the former become depleted to economic extinction. An alternative to this view, that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low-trophic-level fisheries ("fishing through the food web"), may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide, we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically, only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper-trophic-level species, compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n = 6) or significant increases (n = 15) in upper-trophic-level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web.},

In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A dramatic increase in prevalence of the recently discovered bopyrid isopod parasite, Orthione griffenis, likely introduced in the 1980s from Asia to the Pacific coast of North America, coincided with the 2002 collapse of a population of its burrowing mud shrimp host, Upogebia pugettensis, in Willapa Bay, Washington that had been stable since monitoring began in 1988. An examination of whether O. griffenis infections were sufficient to cause this decline and other recently noted U. pugettensis population collapses in Pacific Coast estuaries was conducted. O. griffenis prevalence was the highest in large reproductive-sized female shrimp and caused an estimated average 68{\%} loss of U. pugettensis reproduction in Yaquina Bay, Oregon over a 5-year period. O. griffenis prevalence fluctuated from year to year, but trends were similar in all estuaries sampled. Uninfected shrimp transplanted back into locations from which they had disappeared acquired the parasite, suggesting that O. griffenis is extremely effective at finding its host even in estuaries with very low host density. Since both U. pugettensis and O. griffenis have pelagic larval stages, their population dynamics are also influenced by coastal nearshore oceanography and estuarine recruitment success. Coastwide lack of estuarine recruitment appears to coincide with declines in density of a co-occurring thalassinid shrimp, Neotrypaea californiensis, but cannot alone explain U. pugettensis population collapses. Although patterns observed to date could be explained by the presence of either a native or introduced parasitic castrator, assumptions of a resilient co-evolved host-parasite relationship do not apply for introduced species, so continued efforts to follow the spatial extent and consequences of the O. griffenis-U. pugettensis host-parasite relationship are warranted. -� 2010 U.S. Government},

Here we present evidence to suggest that density-dependent growth in the recruited phase is a key process in the regulation of many fish populations. We analyse 16 fish populations with long-term records of size-at-age and biomass data, and detect significant density-dependent growth in nine. Among-population comparisons show a close, inverse relationship between the estimated decline in asymptotic length per unit biomass density, and the long-term average biomass density of populations. A simple population model demonstrates that regulation by density-dependent growth alone is sufficient to generate the observed relationship. Density-dependent growth should be accounted for in fisheries' assessments, and the empirical relationship established here can provide indicative estimates of the density-dependent growth parameter where population-specific data are lacking.},

Coastal ecosystems are important sources of carbon (primary production) to shelf waters and play a vital role in global nutrient cycling. These systems are especially vulnerable to the effects of human activities and will be the first areas impacted by rising sea levels. Within these coastal ecosystems, microalgal assemblages (microphytobenthos: MPB) are vital for autochthonous carbon fixation. The level of in situ production by MPB mediates the net carbon cycling of transitional ecosystems between net heterotrophic or autotrophic metabolism. In this study, we examine the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations (370, 600, and 1000 ppmv), temperature (6°C, 12°C, and 18°C) and invertebrate biodiversity on MPB biomass in experimental systems. We assembled communities of three common grazing invertebrates (Hydrobia ulvae, Corophium volutator and Hediste diversicolor) in monoculture and in all possible multispecies combinations.

The implications of this variation have rarely been adequately addressed in studies of changes in the fauna over longer time-scales. Without knowledge of the presence or absence of variation at smaller scales, comparisons across longer time-scales must be confounded. Temporal variation in the distribution of the macrofauna of sediments in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia, is described using a nested, hierarchical sampling design. Significant variation was found at temporal scales from days to months. Implications of short-term variation for environmental sampling and monitoring, and the means of overcoming associated problems, are discussed. The conclusions of the present study are applicable to studies of other variables, such as pollutants. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Integral Projection Models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's state influences its vital rates - survival, growth and reproduction - to make population projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates from state variables (e.g., size or age) and covariates (e.g., environment). By combining regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions, or life history strategies. Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be applied to any stage-structured population; here we illustrate IPMs for a series of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species' geographic distributions and life history strategies. IPMs can represent a wide range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover, IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for Matrix Projection Models. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Migrations and home range shifts by adult blue cod Parapercis colias provide an important means of dispersal among resident subpopulations within the Doubtful–Thompson Sound complex, a fjord system in southwestern New Zealand. In the present study we used stable isotope analysis ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) to investigate regional differences in the carbon sources for, and likely migration patterns among, subpopulations of P. colias. We found consistent differences in $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of blood and muscle collected from outer coast (mean ± SE: blood, $\delta$13C = –18.4 ± 0.2, $\delta$15N = 11.5 ± 0.2; muscle, $\delta$13C = –17.9 ± 0.1, $\delta$15N = 13.0 ± 0.1) and inner fjord (mean ± SE: blood, $\delta$13C = –19.9 ± 0.5, $\delta$15N = 9.5 ± 0.3; muscle, $\delta$13C = –19.3 ± 0.4, $\delta$15N = 11.6 ± 0.2) locations, likely reflecting long-term ({\textgreater}1 yr) residency. Inner fjord fish had evidence of significant input of recycled carbon from chemoautotrophic bacteria. On the outer coast, $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C reflected a diet likely supported primarily by new production from macroalgae and phytoplankton. To provide information on isotopic turnover rate of blood and muscle we translocated fish from the outer coast to an inner fjord site and measured change in $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C after 160 d. These data showed a depletion of 13C and 15N with shift in habitat and provided a basis for classifying likely migrants ({\textless}160 d) to each study site. The conclusion that populations of blue cod within Doubtful Sound are made up of long-term residents with some subsidy from the outer coast has implications for the efficacy of 2 newly established marine reserves in Doubtful Sound and others in Fiordland.},

abstract = {Strong changes in stable isotope tracers commonly occur across estuarine salinity gradients from freshwater to the sea. The tracer gradients reflect the different geochemistries and mixing of freshwater and seawater, and these bottom-up geochemical influences are recorded in estuarine food webs in the isotopic compositions of animals. Conservative mixing calculations suggest that watershed-level inputs of freshwater and nutrients should exert strong influences on isotopic values of estuarine consumers, especially consumers such as bivalves that largely depend on phytoplankton production. Deviations from conservative isotope mixing also occur, and the magnitude of these deviations measures the strength of within-estuary, organic matter cycling for estuarine food webs, especially inputs of non-phytoplankton foods such as macrophyte detritus and benthic algae. Measuring consumer isotopes across salinity gradients should be a relatively simple way to monitor effects of watershed nutrient loading and hydrologic flushing in supporting estuarine fisheries production.

abstract = {Oyster culture operations on the West coast of North America have developed into complete farming operations for the introduced Japanese oyster, Crassostrea gigas, which now covers vast areas of the intertidal landscape, particularly in Washington State where the pesticide carbaryl has also been used to control burrowing thalassinid shrimp for more than 30 years. Field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of these habitat modifications on the benthic community in Willapa, Bay Washington (124°06′W, 46°24′N) where 50{\%} of the state's oyster production occurs. Results indicated that the primary long-term effect of carbaryl application was removal of the two species of thalassinid shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis and Upogebia pugettensis), which dominated the community at the start of the experiment and clearly influenced community composition themselves. Small peracarid crustaceans like the amphipods Corophium acherusicum and Eohaustorius estuarius experienced the most significant short-term mortalities, but generally recruited back to treated sites within 3 months, and were often more abundant on treated than untreated sites 1 year after carbaryl application. Results for molluscs were mixed, with no significant effect on Macoma spp, but a significant effect on the commensal clam Crytomya californica and mixed results for the cockle Clinocardium nutalli. Polychaetes were the least susceptible to carbaryl and with the exception of a short-term effect on oligochaetes, no significant negative effects were observed. The addition of oysters did not affect the infaunal community in this study, however greater abundance of epifaunal organisms like mussels, scaleworms, and the amphipod Amphithoe valida, which builds tubes in algae attached to shells, was observed. Carbaryl, which is currently applied to roughly 242 ha ({\textless}6{\%} of the intertidal) in Willapa Bay on an annual basis, has a variable but relatively short-term effect on the benthic community, which should be viewed in the context of other oyster culture operations like the addition of oysters themselves to a community often dominated by burrowing thalassinid shrimp which clearly control its dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {We studied direct and indirect effects of essential fatty acids (EFA) on Daphnia magna reproduction. Daphnia females that received EFA enriched algae over their entire lifespan produced larger broods than females fed control algae. However, EFA-enriched females were also 91{\%} heavier than control females, which potentially explain the larger investment in reproduction. Thus, with such a large difference in female mass, it is difficult to differentiate the direct effect of the EFA addition from the indirect (maternal size) effects on reproduction. To assess the direct effects on reproduction, we performed two experiments in which we enriched female diets with a range of fatty acids. To minimize maternal size differences, we applied the EFA enrichments only to mature daphniids and studied the effects on reproduction during and after two time intervals (15-16 and 7 days). Limiting the enrichment phase until after maturity decreased the maternal size differences over the enrichment phase among the fatty acid treatments from an average of 91{\%} (for life time enrichment) to 29{\%} after 15-16 days maternal enrichment interval, to 18{\%} after the 7 day interval. Minimizing size differences between differently enriched females decreased the differences in brood size and offspring size. Neonates from control females were more severely affected by starvation than offspring from females that received saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid enrichments. Under low food concentrations, only neonates that had access to polyunsaturated fatty acids had positive growth rates, thus showing that although dietary fatty acids can be used for energy purposes, specific fatty acids are required to build new biomass. One consequence of our findings is that offspring size does not serve as a good estimate of offspring quality when feeding on different resource qualities.},

abstract = {Mortality, rates of water loss, aerobic and anaerobic metabolic rates and changes in the parameters of cellular energy status were monitored in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis from different latitudes and shore levels during prolonged air exposure at elevated temperatures (30 degree C). Prolonged air exposure, imitating environmental conditions during summer low tide at high-shore levels, resulted in the onset of anaerobic metabolism, as indicated by the significant accumulation of succinate and alanine and a considerable depletion of high-energy phosphates (ATP and phospho-L-arginine, PLA). However, anaerobic metabolism accounted for only 1 to 2{\%} of total ATP turnover in all groups, the remainder being supplied by aerobic metabolism. Snails from the White Sea population, which were more resistant to prolonged air exposure at 30 degree C than North Sea specimens, demonstrated higher anaerobic capacity and a depression of overall metabolic rate by ca 20{\%} in air, whereas the less-resistant North Sea animals displayed very low anaerobic metabolic rates and elevated aerial oxygen consumption rates (110 to 125{\%} of the rate observed in water). Within the White Sea population, high-shore periwinkles demonstrated higher resistance to prolonged air exposure than low-shore specimens associated with lower evaporation water loss, reduced rates of anaerobic ATP turnover, higher stores of L-aspartate and lower defended values of ATP and PLA. In contrast, no differences were found between high- and low-shore snails in the North Sea. This may reflect environmental conditions at the 2 study sites, with stronger contrasts between high- and low-shore habitats in the White Sea than in the North Sea. In general, our data show that adaptation to prolonged air exposure at elevated temperatures, which may occur at high-shore levels during summer low tide, does not necessarily involve increased anaerobic capacity in L. saxatilis. Instead, enhanced abilities for water conservation and metabolic rate depression combined with increased stores of fermentable substrate seem to be crucial for survival during prolonged periods of emersion.},

abstract = {In the deep sea, biological data are often sparse; hence models capturing relationships between observed fauna and environmental variables (acquired via acoustic mapping techniques) are often used to produce full coverage species assemblage maps. Many statistical modelling techniques are being developed, but there remains a need to determine the most appropriate mapping techniques. Predictive habitat modelling approaches (redundancy analysis, maximum entropy and random forest) were applied to a heterogeneous section of seabed on Rockall Bank, NE Atlantic, for which landscape indices describing the spatial arrangement of habitat patches were calculated. The predictive maps were based on remotely operated vehicle (ROV) imagery transects high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) sidescan backscatter maps. Area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy indicated similar performances for the three models tested, but performance varied by species assemblage, with the transitional species assemblage showing the weakest predictive performances. Spatial predictions of habitat suitability differed between statistical approaches, but niche similarity metrics showed redundancy analysis and random forest predictions to be most similar. As one statistical technique could not be found to outperform the others when all assemblages were considered, ensemble mapping techniques, where the outputs of many models are combined, were applied. They showed higher accuracy than any single model. Different statistical approaches for predictive habitat modelling possess varied strengths and weaknesses and by examining the outputs of a range of modelling techniques and their differences, more robust predictions, with better described variation and areas of uncertainties, can be achieved. As improvements to prediction outputs can be achieved without additional costly data collection, ensemble mapping approaches have clear value for spatial management.},

abstract = {Stock assessments commonly allow parameters to vary across fishery or jurisdictional boundaries, often by treating each region as a unit stock. However, animals generally disperse in response to spatial habitat features to satisfy particular life history requirements, and these features are often not congruent with fishery or jurisdictional boundaries. Thus, populations are often spatially structured at scales distinct from those acknowledged in assessments. Furthermore, when the spatial structure arises from dispersal of a common pool of recruits, redefining unit stock boundaries may not adequately capture these dynamics. Here we test the utility of spatially referencing parameters (vulnerability and catchability) in a statistical catch-at-age stock assessment model as a simple approach to account for life history variation of walleye (Sander vitreus) when information on explicit movement rates is unavailable. We apply several alternative assessment models to Lake Erie walleye - a population identified as displaying age-specific differences in the extent of dispersal from spawning grounds - to investigate the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity at ecologically important scales in stock assessments. Comparisons of the most parsimonious assessment models (based on a deviance information criterion) with and without spatially referenced parameters (by basin) highlighted the importance of estimating regional vulnerability and catchability. There was strong statistical evidence that incorporating spatially referenced parameters at a scale relevant to walleye dispersal patterns improved model fit, and the change altered estimates of stock size and fishing mortality. For example, estimates of total age-2 and older walleye abundance in the most recent year decreased by 16{\%} (34{\%} for ages 7 and older) and fully selected fishing mortality increased by 70{\%} after incorporating walleye spatial population structure. These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial aspects in stock assessments at scales relevant to the life history of the species or group of species under consideration. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The manual follows the same order of the lectures in the last course held in IPIMAR (November/December 1997). It starts with an introduction to the mathematical models applied in Fish Stock Assessment and some considerations on the importance of fisheries. The need for a rational management of the fishing resources is then stressed, this being indispensable for an adequate exploitation, aiming at conservation, to occur. The basic assumptions about a model and the concepts of different variation rates of a characteristic in relation to time (or to other characteristics) are presented, highlighting the most important aspects of the simple and exponential linear models which are used in the chapters that follow. After some considerations on the concept of cohort, models for the evolution in time of the number and weight of the individuals that constitute the cohort are developed, including models for the individual growth of the cohort. In the chapter concerning the study of the stock, the fishing pattern and its components are defined, the most used models for the stockrecruitment relation are presented, as well as the short and long term projections of a stock. With regard to fishing resources management, the discussion is focused on the biological reference points (target points, limit points and precautionary points) and fisheries regulation measures. The last chapter, which presents and discusses theoretical models of fish stock assessment, deals with production models (also designated as general production models) and with the long and shortterm projections of the catches and biomasses. Finally, the general methods of estimating parameters are described and some of the most important methods are presented, with special relevance to the cohort analysis by age and length. Then a solution of the exercises from the last course held in IPIMAR, is presented by the author and the scientist Manuela Azevedo.},

The present study examined the use of otolith microchemistry as a stock separation tool for redfish. By determining minor and trace elements in redfish otoliths from various areas in the North Atlantic, geographic and temporal variations in otolith microchemistry were investigated. Relatively high temporal stability in otolith elemental composition was found for juvenile redfish from nursery areas off East Greenland. Elemental concentrations in the nucleus, juvenile and marginal otolith zones differed significantly between areas and showed consistent longitudinal trends for some elements. Multivariate analysis of element constituents by area, however, revealed poor geographic separation ({\textless} 50{\%} cross-validated classification) for both species. Otoliths of juvenile S. mentella from demersal nursery grounds and adjacent pelagic habitats showed no significant differences between areas. The results are in accordance with the recently observed low morphometric and genetic heterogeneity of redfish across the North Atlantic. It is, however, unclear if the lack of clear spatial separation by natal signatures is due to a common origin of the investigated fish or due to limited variability of the chemical composition of their ambient environment. },

abstract = {(With 3 figures) ABSTRACT A preliminary study was done on the age-pigment lipofuscin content in the brains of captive Farfantepenaeus paulensis juveniles (5 months old) and wild adults (estimated age of 12-15 months). Random samples of 6 individuals were obtained from each group (juvenile and adult) for histological analysis. Serial sections (6 µm) of the brains were mounted without staining and observed in an epifluorescent microscope. The fluorescent images of the five most central sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass (OLCM) of each individual were digitized for image analysis. The lipofuscin gran-ule mean diameter was similar in both groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05), however the lipofuscin area fraction (per-centage of the OLCM occupied by pigment granules) was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) in the adult shrimp. The detection of lipofuscin granules in 5 month old F. paulensis indicates that lipofuscin deposition probably takes place even earlier in the juvenile phase. Our results suggested that the amount of granules in the F. paulensis OLCM is related to age, but further studies are necessary to evalu-ate the relationship between lipofuscin content and the age of captive F. paulensis.

abstract = {A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of feeding various sources of dietary lipid on weight gain, feed conversion, survival and fatty acid composition of juvenile Penaeus vannamei. Seven semi-purified diets (35{\%} protein and 3400 kcal of metabolizable energy kg-1) containing defatted, freeze-dried shrimp meal, 1.0{\%} soybean lecithin and 0.5{\%} cholesterol were supplemented with 6.5{\%} of either stearic acid, coconut, safflower, corn, soybean, linseed or menhaden fish oils. Each diet was fed to shrimp (1.00 ?? 0.03 g average weight) in four replicate aquaria four times daily for 10 weeks. Weight gain, feed conversion and survival were best for shrimp fed the diet containing menhaden fish oil. Shrimp fed the linseed oil diet had the second highest weight gain, followed by shrimp on soybean oil, corn oil, stearic acid, coconut oil and safflower oil diets, respectively. Feed conversion values were a reflection of weight gain. Results of this study show that both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are dietary essential for juvenile Penaeus vannamei, although n-3 fatty acids promoted faster growth than n-6. However, highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) (20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3) had better growth-promoting effect than 18:3n-3, due probably to the limited ability of shrimp to bioconvert fatty acids to polyenoic forms of longer chain length. The fatty acid composition of the shrimp generally reflected that of the dietary lipids, especially for the diets containing unsaturated fatty acids. Shrimp fed stearic acid and coconut oil diets low in polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulated high levels of 16:1n-7 and 18:1 n-9.},

abstract = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large space is opened up is a consequence of the following mechanisms. "Opportunist" species with broad dispersal powers and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the presence of adults of their own or other species. Several alternative mechanisms may then determine which species replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded them. At present there exists little evidence in support of this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all species resist invasions of com- petitors. The first occupants preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus releasing re- sources. Only then can later colonists reach maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of this model. In the majority of natural communities succession is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches a stage in which further change is on a small scale as individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that offspring of the same species are much less favored than those of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep changing, producing local instability. Whether the average species composition of the whole tract does not change, exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has not yet been decided for any natural community. },

We conducted field caging experiments and collected weekly nekton samples in shallow open-water habitat in a marsh pond during summer and fall 2007 in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA, to estimate growth and morality rates of juvenile white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Growth rates (mean ± 1 SE) were lower during the summer experiment (0.77 ± 0.05 mm d–1) than the fall (0.91 ± 0.04 mm d–1), and high summer water temperatures may have inhibited shrimp growth. Cohort analysis to derive mortality estimates from 15 weekly sampling trips failed due to extended periods of continuous recruitment, the lack of clearly identifiable cohorts, and high temporal variability in abundance estimates. Catch-curve analysis provided estimates of mean daily instantaneous mortality (Z) during the sampling period of 0.181 for post-larvae and early juveniles {\textless}28 mm TL and 0.083 for larger juveniles {\textgreater}28 mm. The mortality estimates must be interpreted with caution due to potential problems meeting the assumptions of catch-curve analysis. Despite the challenges, comparisons of vital rates among habitats are required to validate long-held paradigms on the functioning of estuarine nurseries and the importance of various coastal habitats in the support of fishery species.},

abstract = {Crustaceans play an important role in marine ecosystem and worldwide fisheries. Accurate and quantitative description of growth is crucial in modelling the demographics and fisheries stock assessment. The stepwise growth as a result of the moulting process and the lack of permanent calcified structures make the traditional approaches developed for finfish inappropriate for crustaceans. This study reviews the data collection, quantitative methods and various sources of uncertainty for modelling the growth of crustacean. The methods were reviewed based on their data requirement and mathematical/ statistical complexity ranging from simple growth rate, continuous growth curve to stepwise growth curve and size transition matrix. A comparative example of different growth models was illustrated with four selected crustaceans: American lobster (Homarus americanus, Nephropidae), Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister, Cancridae), blue crab (Cal- linectes sapidus, Portunidae) and pronghorn spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus, Palinuridae).

abstract = {Changing environmental conditions in the North Pacific are altering the lipid/fatty acid (FA) composition of zooplankton assemblages, but the consequences to resident fish larvae are unknown. In the laboratory, we reared Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus larvae over 4 wk on prey enriched with varying levels of 2 essential FAs (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 22:6$\omega$-3, and eicosapentanoic acid, EPA, 20:5$\omega$-3) to determine how this species responded to such changes in prey quality. Ratios of DHA:EPA were chosen to represent the natural variation observed in zooplankton of the North Pacific. We tested the hypotheses whether (1) energetically similar diets comprised of varying levels of DHA and EPA affect growth and survival in Pacific cod larvae, and (2) the highest levels of DHA:EPA (2:1) are optimal for Pacific cod larvae, as it has been shown for Atlantic species. Pacific cod larvae grew fastest with diets containing high levels of $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA {\textgreater} 22{\%}). Diets with the same total lipid content but different DHA:EPA ratios ({\textless} 0.1:1 to 2:1) also mediated growth and lipid composition of the larvae. Unlike Atlantic cod, Pacific cod larvae did not show as high a requirement for DHA relative to EPA but rather achieved largest size-at-age with intermediate DHA:EPA ratios (0.8:1 to 1.1:1). This range most closely resembled DHA:EPA ratios reported from North Pacific copepods, suggesting anomalous years with an over- or under-abundance of DHA-rich dinoflagellates or EPA-rich diatoms may be detrimental to survival and growth of Pacific cod larvae in the field.},

abstract = {This study investigated postlarval dispersal of soft-bottom macrofauna at a spatially complex intertidal mudflat comprising patches of bare sediment and an ecosystem engineer, the mussel Mytilus edulis. At each of four sites in Guard Point Cove, Maine, USA, we took core samples and deployed bedload traps in bare sediment and mussel bed habitats to estimate ambient densities, rates of sediment flux, and several measures of postlarval dispersal. Univariate and multivariate nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) results showed few significant site effects and no habitat??site interactions. In contrast, there were numerous significant habitat effects. Compared to the bare sediment, the mussel bed habitat had: fewer species; higher ambient density and proportional abundance of the oligochaete Tubificoides benedeni (the dominant species in both habitats); lower ambient densities and proportional abundances of major taxa and the nonoligochaetes as a group; and higher sediment flux and relative (i.e., per capita) dispersal of nonoligochaetes. Macrofauna species dispersed in relative proportions that were different from those in the ambient assemblage. Per capita T. benedeni transport rates were low in mussel beds compared to those for nonoligochaetes, consistent with the view that beds represent favorable habitat for oligochaetes. The number of total macrofauna individuals trap-1 day-1 was negatively correlated with ambient density and positively correlated with sediment flux in both habitats, but these relationships were significant only in the mussel bed. The results indicate that altered transport rates of sediment and postlarvae are important mechanisms by which mussels act as ecosystem engineers to modify soft-bottom habitats. Differential transport rates caused by aggregations of mussels and other foundation species must be considered in explanations of spatial pattern in soft-bottom communities. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Protists fed the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens were grown in batch and continuous culture to define the isotope discrimination between NH-4+ microbial biomass, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) for culture systems closed or open to exogenous nutrient inputs. In batch cultures of a flagellate Pseudobodo sp. and a scuticociliate Uronema sp., the nitrogen isotope discrimination between biomass and NH-4+ was 3 to 5{\%}. during exponential growth of protists corresponding to the highest rates of biomass-specific NH-4+ release. The delta-15N of DON, calculated by mass balance, was very depleted in 15N relative to NH-4+ and biomass during exponential and early stationary growth when DON and dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) concentrations increased. In contrast to batch culture results, for continuous culture of the flagellate the isotope discrimination between biomass and NH-4+ and the change in the calculated delta-15N of DON were small: 1 to 2{\%}.. Based on rates of thymidine incorporation and turnover of DFAA, protist excretion and bacterial uptake of DON were less coupled for exponentially growing protists fed starved bacteria in batch cultures than for the flagellate fed active bacteria growing in a 2-stage continuous culture. Coupling between release and utilization of DON, as well as isotope effects associated with protist metabolism, are proposed to constrain the nitrogen isotope dynamics of NH-4+, suspended PON, and DON within marine ecosystems, especially those environments dominated by regenerated primary production.},

abstract = {The universal temperature-dependence model (UTD) of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) proposes that temperature controls mass-scaled, whole-animal resting metabolic rate according to the first principles of physics (Boltzmann kinetics). Controversy surrounds the model's implication of a mechanistic basis for metabolism that excludes the effects of adaptive regulation, and it is unclear how this would apply to organisms that live in fringe environments and typically show considerable metabolic adaptation. We explored thermal scaling of metabolism in a rocky-shore eulittoral-fringe snail (Echinolittorina malaccana) that experiences constrained energy gain and fluctuating high temperatures (between 25°C and approximately 50°C) during prolonged emersion (weeks). In contrast to the prediction of the UTD model, metabolic rate was often negatively related to temperature over a benign range (30-40°C), the relationship depending on (i) the temperature range, (ii) the degree of metabolic depression (related to the quiescent period), and (iii) whether snails were isolated within their shells. Apparent activation energies (E) varied between 0.05 and -0.43 eV, deviating excessively from the UTD's predicted range of between 0.6 and 0.7 eV. The lowering of metabolism when heated should improve energy conservation in a high-temperature environment and challenges both the theory's generality and its mechanistic basis.},

Absence of lugworms resulted in sediment clogging with organic-rich fine particles, an eightfold decrease in sediment permeability, low oxygen penetration depths, and accumulation of reduced mineralization products in the pore water. The sand flat inhabited by lugworms had low fine-particle and chlorophyll contents and low sulfide and nutrient concentrations in the pore water. The effects were not limited to the vicinity of lugworm burrows but extended throughout the entire sediment down to ,20-cm depth. Sediments with the lugworm shared the characteristic of low-organic, advection-driven permeable sand rather than of muddy, diffusion-dominated sediments in the absence of lugworms. Areal oxygen uptake rates depended strongly on hydrodynamic conditions: under calm conditions, sedimentary oxygen uptake was slightly higher at the exclusion site. Experimental flushing using controlled hydrodynamic conditions showed that oxygen uptake at the lugworm site would be higher during more dynamic conditions (e.g., storms) due to significantly deeper oxygen penetration permitted by higher sediment permeability. Our results indicate an interactive effect of bioturbating organisms and hydrodynamics on water–sediment exchange processes and highlight the importance of benthic infauna for sedimentary processes even in physically dominated systems.

This paper presents analyses of the moulting increment and moulting frequency results based on tag and recapture experiments. The mean increments in carapace length per moult of males (immature and mature) are estimated to be 17.0 mm for all premoult carapace lengths between 67 and 172 mm, while the increment decreased from 14.4 to 5.1 mm for females as they became ovigerous. The results show that the growth increments of the red king crab in Varanger are within the ranges reported in the eastern Bering Sea.

abstract = {Contemporary theory for thermal adaptation of ectothermic metazoans focuses on the maximization of energy gain and performance (locomotion and foraging). Little consideration is given to the selection for mechanisms that minimize resting energy loss in organisms whose energy gain is severely constrained. We tested a hypothetical framework for thermal performance of locomotor activity (a proxy for energy gain) and resting metabolism (a proxy for energy loss) in energetically compromised snails in the littoral fringe zone, comparing this with existing theory. In contrast to theory, the thermal ranges and optima for locomotor performance and metabolic performance of Echinolittorina malaccana are mismatched, and energy gain is only possible at relatively cool temperatures. To overcome thermal and temporal constraints on energy gain while experiencing high body temperatures (23{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}50{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C), these snails depress resting metabolism between 35 and 46{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C (thermally insensitive zone). The resulting bimodal relationship for metabolism against temperature contrasts with the unimodal or exponential relationships of most ectotherms. Elevation of metabolism above the breakpoint temperature for thermal insensitivity (46{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C) coincides with the induction of a heat shock response, and has implications for energy expenditure and natural selection. Time-dependent mortality is initiated at this breakpoint temperature, suggesting a threshold above which the rate of energy demand exceeds the capacity for cellular energy generation (rate of ATP turnover). Mortality in a thermal range that elevates rather than limits aerobic metabolism contrasts with the hypothesis that cellular oxygen deficiency underlies temperature-related mortality. The findings of this study point to the need to incorporate aspects of resting metabolism and energy conservation into theories of thermal adaptation.},

abstract = {Lipids provide the densest form of energy in marine ecosystems. They are also a solvent and absorption carrier for organic contaminants and thus can be drivers of pollutant bioaccumulation. Among the lipids, certain essential fatty acids and sterols are considered to be important determinants of ecosystem health and stability. Fatty acids and sterols are also susceptible to oxidative damage leading to cytotoxicity and a decrease inmembrane fluidity. The physical characteristics of biologicalmembranes can be defended from the influence of changing temperature, pressure, or lipid peroxidation by altering the fatty acid and sterol composition of the lipid bilayer. Marine lipids are also a valuable tool to measure inputs, cycling, and loss of materials. Their heterogeneous nature makes them versatile biomarkers that are widely used in marine trophic studies, oſten with the help of multivariate statistics, to delineate carbon cycling and transfer of materials. Principal components analysis has a strong following as it permits data reduction and an objective interpretation of results, but several more sophisticated multivariate analyses which are more quantitative are emerging too. Integrating stable isotope and lipid data can facilitate the interpretation of both data sets and can provide a quantitative estimate of transfer across trophic levels.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of sedimentary nitrogen and organic carbon are widely used as proxy variables for biogeochemical parameters and processes in the water column. In order to investigate alterations of the primary isotopic signal by sedimentary diagenetic processes, we determined concentrations and isotopic compositions of inorganic nitrogen (IN), organic nitrogen (ON), total nitrogen (TN), and total organic carbon (TOC) on one short core recovered from sediments of the eastern subtropical Atlantic, between the Canary Islands and the Moroccan coast. Changes with depth in concentration and isotopic composition of the different fractions were related to early diagenetic conditions indicated by pore water concentrations of oxygen, nitrate, and ammonium. Additionally, the nature of the organic matter was investigated by Rock-Eval pyrolysis and microscopic analysis. A decrease in ON during aerobic organic matter degradation is accompanied by an increase of the 15N/14N ratio. Changes in the isotopic composition of ON can be described by Rayleigh fractionation kinetics which are probably related to microbial metabolism. Tne influence of IN depleted in 15N on the bulk sedimentary (TN) isotope signal increases due to organic matter degradation, compensating partly the isotopic changes in ON. In anoxic sediments, fixation of ammonium between clay lattices results in a decrease of stable nitrogen isotope ratio of IN and TN. Changes in the carbon isotopic composition of TOC have to be explained by Rayleigh fractionation in combination with different remineralization kinetics of organic compounds with different isotopic composition. We have found no evidence for preferential preservation of terrestrial organic carbon. Instead, both TOC and refractory organic carbon are dominated by marine organic matter. Refractory organic carbon is depleted in 13C compared to TOC. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Phillips2005,
abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models are often used to quantify source contributions to a mixture. Examples include pollution source identification; trophic web studies; analysis of water sources for soils, plants; or water bodies, and many others. A common problem is having too many sources to allow a unique solution. We discuss two alternative procedures for addressing this problem. One option is a priori to combine sources with similar signatures so the number of sources is small enough to provide a unique solution. Aggregation should be considered only when isotopic signatures of clustered sources are not significantly different, and sources are related so the combined source group has some functional significance. For example, in a food web analysis, lumping several species within a trophic guild allows more interpretable results than lumping disparate food sources, even if they have similar isotopic signatures. One result of combining mixing model sources is increased uncertainty of the combined end-member isotopic signatures and consequently the source contribution estimates; this effect can be quantified using the IsoError model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/isotopes/isoerror1{\_}04.htm). As an alternative to lumping sources before a mixing analysis, the IsoSource mixing model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/isosource/isosource.htm) can be used to find all feasible solutions of source contributions consistent with isotopic mass balance. While ranges of feasible contributions for each individual source can often be quite broad, contributions from functionally related groups of sources can be summed a posteriori, producing a range of solutions for the aggregate source that may be considerably narrower. A paleo-human dietary analysis example illustrates this method, which involves a terrestrial meat food source, a combination of three terrestrial plant foods, and a combination of three marine foods. In this case, a posteriori aggregation of sources allowed strong conclusions about temporal shifts in marine versus terrestrial diets that would not have otherwise been discerned.},

abstract = {To assess the significance of nutrient interactions on animal performance, life-history experiments were conducted with the freshwater herbivore Daphnia magna in a system with two limiting nutrients (i.e., sterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs]). By experimentally increasing the availability of dietary cholesterol either in the absence or in the presence of different dietary PUFAs we investigated whether dietary PUFAs differ in their potential to affect the sterol-limited growth kinetics of the herbivore. Sterol-limited growth responses of D. magna were characterized by a higher initial slope of the saturation curves and lower threshold concentrations in the presence of dietary PUFAs. This suggests significant interactions between limiting nutrients and lower dietary sterol requirements in the presence of dietary PUFAs. In contrast to somatic growth rates, which were significantly increased only by additional supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), population growth rates were significantly affected by additional supplementation with linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and in particular EPA and arachidonic acid. The fatty acid composition of D. magna reflected that of their diet. However, animals fed the DHA supplemented diet contained considerable amounts of EPA, indicating a retro-conversion of DHA into EPA within their metabolism. The fitness of resource-limited consumers is strongly affected by complex interactions between limiting nutrients and this topic has to be considered in experimental and theoretical studies investigating nutrient-limited growth responses of animals to accurately assess consequences for population dynamics.},

Euphausia pacifica growth rates were significantly higher during June 2006 than during July 2004 and June 2005 but not significantly different between the RISE study area and Newport Hydrographic (NH) Line, Oregon. Euphausiid brood sizes were significantly higher during August 2005 than during any other cruise for both E. pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera; our experiments did not indicate that brood sizes were higher in the northern part of the RISE study region. E. pacifica broods were larger for NH than RISE, but T. spinifera broods were not. Significant differences in egg production rates (EPRs) were found among cruises for both Calanus pacificus and C. marshallae, with higher EPRs during August 2005. EPRs on other cruises were less than half the maximum rates known for these species. EPRs of C. marshallae were similar between RISE and NH; C. pacificus EPRs were significantly higher (lower) in the RISE region in 2005 (2006). Interannual differences in ocean conditions affected zooplankton production more strongly than differences in latitude. },

Possible explanations for the patterns in autotroph abundances were exploredthrough examination of their correlations with the physicochemical characteristics of the water column. Studysites were established in each of three zones in the estuary defined by temperature and salinity and were sampled monthlyJune through September 1998 and in July 1999. Z. marina and macroalgal cover and Z. marina shoot density weremeasured in 0.25-m2 plots at each site. After cover estimates and shoot counts were made, material was harvested fordetermination of Z. marina and macroalgal biomass. Water column variables were measured from stations near eachstudy site and composited on a depth-averaged, monthly basis for each zone. Both Z. marina and green macroalgalabundance differed between sites, over the summer in 1998, and between years. Seasonal patterns were most obviousfor Z. marina at the site closest to the ocean while the pattern in macroalgal abundance suggested a bloom moving upriver as summer progressed. The physicochemical characteristics of the zones differed with the season and could berelated to the patterns in Z. marina and macroalgal abundance. In particular, salinity was positively correlated with Z.marina abundance, while abundance of both autotrophs was related to light availability. Z. marina biomass ranged 19--109 g dry weight m22; green macroalgae biomass ranged 5--234 g dry weight m22. The biomass of the green macroalgaeat several sites and dates equaled or exceed that of the Z. marina suggesting the potential for nuisance algal bloomsdoes exist in Yaquina Bay.},

The euphausiids were maintained separately (1 individual per jar) from the third furcilia (FIII) to the juvenile stage to observe developmental pathways. Individual cohorts developed at nearly the same rate until the first furcilia stage, after which 2 cohorts began to develop significantly faster than the others. Median time to the juvenile stage ranged from 51.9 to 60.6 d, with significant differences among cohorts. The first calyptopis stage and the third furcilia stage lasted longer than any other stages and appear to be bottlenecks in the development of this species. Individual development from FIII to juvenile varied widely both within and among cohorts. We observed 4 main developmental pathways. Over half of the euphausiids skipped 1 development stage between FIII and juvenile (58 {\%}), and none skipped multiple stages.

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is often used to identify the relative contributions of various food resources to a consumer's diet. Some Bayesian isotopic mixing models now incorporate uncertainty in the isotopic signatures of consumers, sources and trophic enrichment factors (e.g. SIAR, MixSIR). This had made model outputs more comprehensive, but at the expense of simple model evaluation, and there is no quantitative method for determining whether a proposed mixing model is likely to explain the isotopic signatures of all consumers, before the model is run. Earlier linear mixing models (e.g. IsoSource) are easier to evaluate, such that if a consumer's isotopic signature is outside the mixing polygon bounding the proposed dietary sources, then mass balance cannot be established and there is no logical solution. This can be used to identify consumers for exclusion or to reject a model outright. This point-in-polygon assumption is not inherent in the Bayesian mixing models, because the source data are distributions not average values, and these models will quantify source contributions even when the solution is very unlikely. We use a Monte Carlo simulation of mixing polygons to apply the point-in-polygon assumption to these models. Convex hulls (‘mixing polygons') are iterated using the distributions of the proposed dietary sources and trophic enrichment factors, and the proportion of polygons that have a solution (i.e. that satisfy point-in-polygon) is calculated. This proportion can be interpreted as the frequentist probability that the proposed mixing model can calculate source contributions to explain a consumer's isotopic signature. The mixing polygon simulation is visualised with a mixing region, which is calculated by testing a grid of values for point-in-polygon. The simulation method enables users to quantitatively explore assumptions of stable isotope analysis in mixing models incorporating uncertainty, for both two- and three-isotope systems. It provides a quantitative basis for model rejection, for consumer exclusion (those outside the 95{\%} mixing region) and for the correction of trophic enrichment factors.

abstract = {Monthly samplings were carried out during 1994-1996 at an intermediate and at a dissipative sandy beaches of southern Chile (Calfuco and Mehu{\'{i}}n, respectively; ca. 39{\textordmasculine} S), to evaluate the predictions of the swash exclusion hypothesis on the population abundances and life history of the crustacean macroinfauna inhabiting the intertidal of that beaches. It is hypothesized that only true intertidal species (i.e., that directly affected by the swash) will be affected by differences in beach morphodynamic types. That species were the cirolanid isopods Excirolana braziliensis and Excirolana hirsuticauda and the anomuran crab Emerita analoga. On the other hand, the almost supralittoral amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata should not be affected by differences in beach morphodynamic types. The total population abundances of O. tuberculata and E. analoga were significantly higher at the intermediate beach of Calfuco, that of E. braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda at the dissipative beach of Mehu{\'{i}}n. While the abundances of ovigerous females of O. tuberculata and E. analoga were higher at Calfuco, that of the ovigerous females of E. braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda did not differ between beaches. Juveniles of O. tuberculata had higher abundances at Calfuco, while that of the other species peaked at Mehu{\'{i}}n. The reproductive period of amphipods and isopods peaked at the same spring-summer months at both beaches. E. analoga also reproduced during spring- summer months, but their abundances peaked at different months. While juveniles of O. tuberculata peaked at similar times at both beaches, those of Excirolana braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda peaked later at Mehu{\'{i}}n. Juveniles of E. analoga had very low abundances during the first spring-summer period of this study; during the second one they peaked at the same month (October) at both beaches. The growth curves and growth parameters of O. tuberculata, E. braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda did not differ significantly between beaches, even when O. tuberculata tended to growth faster at Calfuco. The growth curves and growth parameters for E. analoga were different only for females, which had higher growth at the dissipative site. The natural mortality of the four species showed no significant differences between beaches. Thus, most of the results of this study do not support our hypothesis, suggesting that other factors, apart from beach morphodynamics are important in explaining spatial variability in population abundances and population biology of the sandy beach macroinfauna.},

abstract = {Fatty acids have been used as qualitative markers to trace or confirm predator prey relationships in the marine environment for more than thirty years. More recently, they have also been used to identify key processes impacting the dynamics of some of the world's major ecosystems. The fatty acid trophic marker (FA TM) concept is based on the observation that marine primary producers lay down certain fatty acid patterns that may, be transferred conservatively to, and hence can be recognized in, primary consumers. To identify these fatty acid patterns the literature was surveyed and a partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis of the data was performed, validating the specificity of particular microalgal FATM. Microalgal group specific FA TM have been traced in various primary consumers, particularly in herbivorous calanoid copepods, which accumulate large lipid reserves, and which dominate the zooplankton biomass in high latitude ecosystems. At higher trophic levels these markers of herbivory are obscured as the degree of carnivory increases, and as the fatty acids originate from a variety of dietary sources. Such differences are highlighted in a PLS regression analysis of fatty acid and fatty alcohol compositional data (the components of wax esters accumulated by many marine organisms) of key Arctic and Antarctic herbivorous, omnivorous and carnivorous copepod species. The analysis emphasizes how calanoid copepods separate from other copepods not only by their content of microalgal group specific FATM, but also by their large content of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and alcohols. These monounsaturates have been used to trace and resolve food web relationships in, for example, hyperiid amphipods, euphausiids and fish, which may consume large numbers of calanoid copepods. Results like these are extremely valuable for enabling the discrimination of specific prey species utilized by higher trophic level omnivores and carnivores without the employment of invasive techniques, the thereby for identifying the sources of energetic reseves. A conceptual model of the spatial and temporal dominance of group-specific promary producers, and hence the basic fatty acid patterns available to higher trophic levels is presented. The model is based on stratification, which acts on phytoplankton group dominance through the availability of light and nutrients. It predicts the seasonal and ecosystem specific contribution of diatom and flagellate/microbial loop FATM to food webs as a function of water column stability. Future prospects for the application of FATM in resolving dynamic ecosystem processes are assessed.},

abstract = {The numerical model GETM is used to examine transport pathways and residence time in Willapa Bay, Washington, a macrotidal estuary with a complex channel geometry. When the model is run with realistic forcing, it reproduces both tidal velocities and the decrease of the salt intrusion length with increasing river flow with errors of 5-20{\%}. Furthermore, a more stringent test, when the model is run with tidal forcing only, it reproduces the along-channel profile of the effective horizontal diffusivity K, a direct measure of the strength of subtidal dispersion, which is known from previous empirical estimates. A Lagrangian, particle-tracking method is used to map subtidal transport pathways at the resolution of the model grid. This analysis reveals an interweaving of coherent lateral exchange flows with discontinuous, small-scale dispersion as well as tidal residual currents that in some locations, sharpen rather than smooth gradients between water masses. Comparison between these Lagrangian results and an Eulerian salt flux decomposition suggests that along-channel complexity (channel junctions and channel curvature) is at least as important as cross-sectional depth variation in shaping the subtidal circulation. Finally, a nonconservative tracer method is used to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional maps of residence time. This analysis shows that consistent with previous observational work in Willapa, at all except the highest winter-storm-level river flows, river- and ocean-density-driven exchanges are discernable but secondary to tidal stirring. In all seasons, despite the fact that half the volume of the bay enters and leaves with every tide, average retention times in the upper third of the estuary are 3-5 weeks.},

abstract = {We develop a unified framework for jointly defining population dynamics models and measurements taken on a population. The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator-prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A length-based population model was constructed for Bristol Bay red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, incorporating stochastic growth, gradual recruitment over length, and a bowl-shaped pattern for instantaneous natural mortality as a function of length. A nonlinear least squares approach was used to estimate abundance, recruitment, and natural mortality. The model was applied to abundance and catch data from 1968 to 1993. The observed population abundances fit well with the model. Natural mortality was estimated to be three to six times higher in the early 1980s than during other periods. High natural mortality coupled with high harvest rates and followed by low spawning biomass may have contributed to the collapse of the population in the early 1980s and its continued lack of recovery. The stock-recruitment data estimated from the length-based model provided a good fit to both general and autocorrelated Ricker models. The general Bicker model is supported by strong recruitment associated with intermediate levels of spawning biomass and extremely low recruitment related to low spawning stock; the autocorrelated Ricker model fit the data slightly better and is supported by the fact that extremely strong and weak recruitment occurred successively over two separate periods.},

abstract = {Variation in the recruitment of benthic marine invertebrates is often attributed to the interaction of the supply of new individuals to a habitat and the availability of space for colonisation when they arrive. Also important in determining variation in recruitment is the response of the larvae to the characteristics of the habitat. Larvae of many benthic marine invertebrates have shown great specificity of requirements in setting their limits of distribution at the time of selection of a habitat. The tubeworm Galeolaria caespitosa shows great variation in recruitment from place to place on rocky intertidal seashores and is a gregarious animal with larvae showing directed responses to conspecific adults on the substratum. I hypothesised that, if variation in recruitment of G. caespitosa were independent of conditions on the substratum, the magnitude of recruitment in patches of the same shape but different sizes cleared within continuous mats of conspecific adults would be directly related to the area available for colonisation in the patch. Alternatively, if variation in recruitment were due to the response of larvae to conspecific adults on the substratum, the magnitude of recruitment would be a function of the perimeter of the patch, which, given patches of the same shape, is a measure of the influence of conspecific adults in that patch. To distinguish between these alternatives, small (area = 25 cm2; perimeter = 20 cm) and large (area = 225 cm2; perimeter = 60 cm) square patches were cleared within continuous mats of conspecific adults at four sites and recruitment of G. caespitosa was monitored over two seasons of recruitment. The density of recruits per unit area was, on average, almost three times greater in small than in large patches, indicating that recruitment of G. caespitosa is not directly related to the area of the patch. In contrast, the density of recruits per unit perimeter was not significantly different between small and large patches, indicating that recruitment of G. caespitosa is related to the proximity of conspecific adults in the patch. Therefore, at a given site, the perimeter of patches within mats of G. caespitosa is a better predictor of the relative magnitude of recruitment among patches than that provided by their areas. These results are contrary to many models of invertebrate recruitment that assume close linkage between available space on the substratum and settlement. Moreover, they highlight the importance of behavioural responses of animals at the time of selection of habitat in accounting for variation in recruitment. For populations of organisms that display gregarious behaviour at settlement, or conspecific attraction, this direct relationship between the perimeter of patches and recruitment could be used as a tool in restoring populations to disturbed habitats. The added benefit of such facilitative interactions in restoring populations is that they provide increasing returns to the population for a given supply of potential colonists to a habitat.},

abstract = {The dietary importance of marsh vascular plants (primarily Salicornia virginica), algae and upland particulate inputs to macro-invertebrate consumers was studied in Carpinteria Salt Marsh, southern California, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. This marsh is predominantly a marine or hypersaline system and succulents are the most common vascular plant species. Of invertebrates collected from the vegetated marsh, tidal flats and channels, only detritivores from the vegetated marsh (Traskorchestia traskiana, Melampus olivaceus) had isotope values ($\delta$13C=-20‰) that suggested some use of Salicornia-derived carbon. T. traskiana cultured in the laboratory on decomposing S. virginica or blue-green micro-algal mat had distinctive isotopic signatures, reflecting the capability of this consumer to assimilate carbon and nitrogen derived from these sources. The $\delta$13C values (generally ?16‰ to ?15‰) of species from tidal flats and channels (e.g. Cerithidea californica, Protothaca staminea, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Neotrypaea californiensis) were most similar to values for benthic algae and phytoplankton. Specimens of M. galloprovincialis along a gradient of presumed increase in marine influence had similar isotope values, suggesting little contribution to diet from upland runoff. The present results differ most noticeably from published values in the 13C enrichment of suspension-feeders, suggesting the use of resuspended 13 C-enriched benthic microalgae in tidal channels by these consumers, and in the 13C depletion and 15 N enrichment of plants and consumers along a portion of the marsh boundary receiving inputs of nutrient-enriched perched groundwater. In general, the isotopic composition of macro-invertebrates indicated the incorporation of algal production rather than of S. virginica or upland sources into the marsh food web.},

abstract = {Atlantic cod Gadus morhua in US waters are currently managed as 2 stocks: (1) a Gulf of Maine stock and (2) a Georges Bank and south stock. This designation is decades old and warrants re-evaluation in light of concerns that fisheries management units may not reflect biologically mean- ingful population units. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite loci, the PanI locus, and 5 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to characterize the population genetic structure of cod in US waters. We found significant differentiation among temporally and spatially divergent populations of cod (global FST = 0.0044), primarily stemming from 2 potentially non-neutral loci, and evidence for a population structure that strongly contradicts the current 2-stock management model. This genetic structure was stable over a 5 yr period. Our results indicate that cod in US waters are broadly struc- tured into 3 groups: (1) a northern spring-spawning coastal complex in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), (2) a southern complex consisting of winter-spawning inshore GOM, offshore GOM and sites south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and (3) a Georges Bank population. The strongest differentiation occurs between populations in the northern and southern complex (mean FST = 0.0085), some of which spawn in the same bays in different seasons. By means of mixture analysis, young-of-the-year fish sampled on juvenile nurseries were assigned to the spawning complex of their origin. Our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge that Atlantic cod and other marine fish populations are structured on a finer scale than previously thought and that this structure supports biocomplexity and locally adapted populations. As such, it may be warranted to re-evaluate current management units and tailor management plans toward this finer scale.},

abstract = {The rate of input of new individuals into communities is a key component of community dynamics. Detection of ecosystem responsiveness to climatic perturbations such as El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) can provide insight into how ecosystems will respond to climate change. Although these climate patterns are ocean-based, understanding of their influences on key ecosystem processes in temperate coastal marine ecosystems is limited. Recent analyses documented orders-of-magnitude increases in mussel recruitment in the 2000s relative to the previous decade. To evaluate the generality of this pattern across other intertidal species with planktotrophic dispersive larvae, and determine the extent to which variation in recruitment was explained by climatic and environmental (upwelling) variation, we analyzed patterns of barnacle and mussel recruitment across space (at up to 10 sites across 250. km) and through time (up to 20-years). Compared to mussel recruitment, barnacle recruitment varied far less interdecadally, and showed minimal change in seasonality. Using three analytical approaches, multiple regression, quantile regression and wavelet analysis, we found that recruitment of the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli and mussels Mytilus spp. varied in generally similar ways with climate variation as expressed in ENSO, NPGO, and PDO indices, and with upwelling, as expressed in the Bakun upwelling index. In regression approaches, NPGO and upwelling had the strongest associations with recruitment of all species, with MEI and PDO also having an influence on C. dalli. The strength of the association with the environment varied with recruitment magnitude, however, being generally stronger at intermediate and in some cases high recruitment densities and weak at low recruitment densities. Time series (wavelet) analysis showed that with all environmental indices, the most consistent strong relationships occurred at annual periodicities, but multi-year periodicities were also important with PDO and upwelling indices. Patterns were complex, however, with periods of strong and weak associations at different time periodicities varying differently among the different environmental measures, and in some cases varying from strongly positive to strongly negative associations at the same periodicities through time. These relatively consistent relationships between large-scale climate and upwelling, and recruitment explained a substantial fraction of the variance (37-40{\%}). The {\~{}}. 60{\%} of the variance in recruitment not explained in our analyses is likely due to myriad other factors such as shorter-scale variation in upwelling, internal tidal bores, sea breezes, wave forces, larval behavior, and post-settlement processes. Thus, our analysis adds insights into potential influences on recruitment that occur at ocean basin- to regional scales, and complements the body of work that focuses on the more local-scale and shorter-term mechanistic influences that also help determine the pace at which larvae recruit to the adult habitat. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Post-larval dispersal along the sediment–water interface is an important process in the dynamics of macrobenthic populations and communities in marine sublittoral sediments. However, the modes of post-larval dispersal in low energy sublittoral habitats have been poorly documented. Herein we examined the specific dispersal mechanisms (diel vertical migration, water column, and bedload transport) and corresponding biological traits of the dispersing assemblage. At two sublittoral sites (sheltered and exposed) along the northern coast of Chile, we installed different trap types that capture benthic organisms with specific modes of dispersal (active emergence and passive water column drifting) and also by a combination of mechanisms (bedload transport, passive suspension and settlement from the water column). Our results show that even though there were common species in all types of traps, the post-larval macrobenthic assemblage depended on specific mechanisms of dispersal. At the sheltered site, abundant emerging taxa colonized sediments that were placed 0.5m above the bottom and bedload-transported invertebrates appeared to be associated to the passive drifting of macroalgae. At the exposed site, assemblage dispersal was driven by specific mechanisms e.g. bedload transport and active emergence. At both sites the biological traits “small size, swimming, hard exoskeleton, free living and surface position” were associated to water column and bedload dispersal. This study highlights the importance of (i) the water–sediment interface for dispersal of post-larvae in sublittoral soft-bottom habitat, and (ii) a specific set of biological traits when dispersing either along the bottom or through the water column.},

Traditional food-web studies are based on the natural variability of isotopes and are limited to larger organisms that can be physically separated from their environment. Recent developments allow isotope ratio mea- surements of microbes and this in turn allows the measure- ment of entire food webs, in other words, from small pro- ducers at the bottom to large consumers at the top. Here, I provide a concise review on the use and potential of stable isotopes to reconstruct end-to-end food webs. I will first dis- cuss food web reconstruction based on natural abundances isotope data and will then show that the use of stable isotopes as deliberately added tracers provides complementary infor- mation. Finally, challenges and opportunities for end-to-end food web reconstructions in a changing world are discussed.},

A lthough much has been accomplished in the inter vening years, M remains one of the most difficult parameters to estimate in fishery stock assessments. A number of novel approaches using tagging and telemetry data provide promise for making reliable direct estimates of M for a given stock (Hearn et al., 1998 ; Frusher and Hoenig, 2001; Hightower et al., 2001; Latour et al., 2003; Pollock et al., 2004). However, such methods are often impracticable and fishery scientists must approximate M by using estimates made for other stocks of the same or similar species or by predicting M from features of the species' life history (Beverton and Holt, 1959; Beverton, 1963; Alverson and Carney, 1975; Pauly, 1980; Hoenig, 1983; Peterson and Wroblewski, 1984; Roff, 1984; Gunderson and Dygert, 1988; Chen and Watanabe, 1989; Charnov, 1993; Jensen, 1996; Lorenzen, 1996).},

I derive a general formula for the sensitivity of any output (scalar, vector, or matrix-valued) of the model, to any vector of parameters, using matrix calculus. The matrices describing age-stage dynamics are almost always reducible; I present results giving conditions under which population growth is ergodic from any initial condition. As an example, I analyze a published stage-specific model of Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), an invasive perennial shrub. Sensitivity analysis of the population growth rate finds that the selection gradients on adult survival do not always decrease with age but may increase over a range of ages. This may have implications for the evolution of senescence in stage-classified populations.

abstract = {Humans transformed Western Atlantic coastal marine ecosystems before modern ecological investigations began. Paleoecological, archeological, and historical reconstructions demonstrate incredible losses of large vertebrates and oysters from the entire Atlantic coast. Untold millions of large fishes, sharks, sea turtles, and manatees were removed from the Caribbean in the 17th to 19th centuries. Recent collapses of reef corals and seagrasses are due ultimately to losses of these large consumers as much as to more recent changes in climate, eutrophication, or outbreaks of disease. Overfishing in the 19th century reduced vast beds of oysters in Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries to a few percent of pristine abundances and promoted eutrophication. Mechanized harvesting of bottom fishes like cod set off a series of trophic cascades that eliminated kelp forests and then brought them back again as fishers fished their way down food webs to small invertebrates. Lastly, but most pervasively, mechanized harvesting of the entire continental shelf decimated large, long-lived fishes and destroyed three-dimensional habitats built up by sessile corals, bryozoans, and sponges. The universal pattern of losses demonstrates that no coastal ecosystem is pristine and few wild fisheries are sustainable along the entire Western Atlantic coast. Reconstructions of ecosystems lost only a century or two ago demonstrate attainable goals of establishing large and effective marine reserves if society is willing to pay the costs. Historical reconstructions provide a new scientific framework for manipulative experiments at the ecosystem scale to explore the feasibility and benefits of protection of our living coastal resources.},

Very young barnacle spat were removed from some areas with and without predatory whelks. The whelks moved away from areas without the juvenile barnacles, but stayed and ate barnacles present on the treatment with barnacle recruitment. Predation resulted in almost complete elimination of the cohort of barnacles. In contrast, barnacles survived and grew to reproductive sizes on areas initially without whelks but with recruits. Because of the movements of whelks and their predation on the barnacles, the final abundances of whelks and barnacles in each plot bore little relationship to their initial experimental treatments. Thus caution is needed in interpreting the causes of static patterns of abundance in the field, where the processes involved earlier are not definitely known.

abstract = {Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age- or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative properties such as the existence of a long term population growth rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex, 1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 70, 411-440, 1993) to extend the approach in (Lange and Holmes in J. Appl. Prob. 18, 325-344, 1981). Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow the classification to change during the life cycle. These features are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent "quality" variable), which would be difficult to accommodate in a classical matrix model. We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted from a deterministic version of the model is very different from observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random between-year variation in vital rates.},

abstract = {Two kinds of biogenic structures, roots of seagrasses and tubes of invertebrates, were found to reduce the mobility of a variety of burrowing species, including two polychaetes (Abarenicola pacifica Healy {\&} Wells, A. claparedii Healy {\&} Wells), two bivalves (Macoma nasuta Conrad, Clinocardium nuttalliiConrad), two crustaceans (Upogebia pugettensis (Dana), Callianassa californiensis Dana), a holothurian (Leptosynapta clarkii Heding), and an echinoid (Dendraster excentricus (Eschscholtz)). Comparisons of burrowing in similar sediments showed that: (a) all species had about a two-fold increase in mean time to burial in dense tube-mats of polychaetes and crustaceans; (b) hard-bodied taxa were particularly restricted by roots of Zostera marina L. and were often incapable of penetrating them; (c) roots and tubes together had the greatest impact, with mobility 3 to 37 times slower; and (d) burrowing ability increased when sediments were “pre-burrowed” for 1 day. Comparisons of burrowing rates in different sediments showed effects of physical origin (sediment compaction or sorting). Overall these physical effects were second to those of purely biogenic origin, sediment binding and cohesion by roots and tubes. Nonetheless, physical effects exceeded those of extremely high densities of tube-builders (3160 individuals {\textperiodcentered}0.01 m−2). In all substrata the movement of larger individuals, and the larger of morphologically similar pairs of species (listed second above), were more restricted by roots and tubes than were smaller ones. The results suggest a general mechanism by which dense assemblages of tube-builders and seagrasses may restrict older and larger burrowing organisms. Because physical properties of the sediment and the abundance of other burrowers are also factors affecting mobility, it is not now possible to predict what situations will render this mechanism of interaction important to natural communities.},

abstract = {The fatty acid compositions of fish tissue lipids usually reflect those of the dietary lipids and tissue fatty acid profiles can be modified by altering the sources of fats and oils used in formulating fish feeds. Few attempts have been made to predict the way in which the profiles change, and the time required for the fatty acid profile to stabilise following a dietary change. The simplest model to describe the change in fatty acid composition is one in which the initial fatty acid content becomes diluted as the fish grow and deposit increasing amounts of lipid. The dilution model was tested using data relating to the influence of feed oils (vegetable vs. marine fish) and dietary fat concentrations on growth, body composition, and fatty acid profiles of the tissues (fillet, viscera and carcass) of Atlantic salmon parr and post-smolt. Fish fed feeds containing vegetable (rapeseed and linseed 7:3 v/v) oils at high (34{\%}) or low (22{\%}) lipid concentration during freshwater rearing (mass increase from ca. 19 to 130 g) were switched to feeds containing fish (sand-eel) oil (31{\%} or 18.5{\%} lipid) following parr-smolt transformation. The changes in the proportions of the three tested fatty acids (18:1 isomers, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3) in the total lipids of the salmon tissues during 98 days of on-growing in seawater (mass increase from ca. 130 to 380 g) conformed closely to predictions made on the basis of the simple dilution model. Practical applications, and possible limitations, of the dilution model are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Natural respiration rates of suspension feeders in temperate ecosystems are still poorly known. This lack of information constrains our understanding of the functioning and dynamics of benthic marine ecosystems in temperate areas. We examined the in situ seasonal variation in respiration rate of three benthic suspension feeders (a sponge, an ascidian, and a gorgonian) in northwestern Mediterranean sublittoral communities using a recirculating flow respirometry system. The in situ technique is shown to be highly applicable to seasonal studies of the physiological energetics of benthic suspension feeders. Respiration rates of the three species varied two- to threefold through the annual cycle, exhibiting a marked seasonal pattern but showing no daily cycle or significant day-to-day variability within months. The respiration rate of the sponge and ascidian, active suspension feeders, increased with temperature. The respiration rate of the gorgonian, a passive suspension feeder, did not correlate with temperature. We estimated a Q(10) of 1.1, which indicates that respiration rate in this species is not highly dependent on temperature. Synthesis of new tissue of some Mediterranean benthic suspension feeders, such as gorgonians, does not correlate with temperature, which allowed us to isolate the effects of temperature and synthesis of new tissue on respiration rate. Synthesis of new tissue increased respiration rate of the gorgonian by similar to40{\%}. The low rate of synthesis of new tissue during summer, together with the contraction of polyps and the low Q(10) explains the low respiration rates of the gorgonian observed during the period of highest temperature. These low respiration rates support the hypothesis that energy limitations may underlie summer dormancy in some benthic: suspension-feeding taxa in the Mediterranean.},

abstract = {Stable isotope ratios (typically of carbon and nitrogen) provide one representation of an organism's trophic niche and are widely used to examine aspects of food web structure. Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in delta13C-delta15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

abstract = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-PLUS as they are introduced. Dr. Venables is now Statistician with CSRIO in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-PLUS in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks.},

Two age-structuredmodels were compared: (i) themanagement unit model, wherein cod were grouped based on the current spatially defined US management areas (Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank), and (ii) the biological unit model, consisting of three genetically defined population components (northern spring spawning, southern winter/spring spawning, and eastern Georges Bank spring-spawning groups). Overall, the regional productivity and maximumsustainable yield of the biological unit model was lower compared with themanagement unit model. The biological unitmodel also provided insights on the distribution of productivity in the region, with southern and northern spawning groups being the dominant contributors to the regional spawning–stock biomass and yield and the eastern Georges Bank spawning group being theminority contributor at low to intermediate levels of fishingmortality. The comparison of models revealed that the per- ceptionofAtlantic codderivedfromthemanagementunitmodelwas of a resource that ismore resilient to fishingmortalityandnot as susceptible to “collapse” as indicated by the biological unitmodel. For Atlantic cod, one of themain risks of ignoring population structure appears the potential for overexploitation of segments of the population. Consideration of population structure of cod changed our perception of the magnitude and distribution of productivity in the region, suggesting that expectations of sustainable yield of cod in US waters should be reconsidered.},

abstract = {1. The use of stable isotope data to infer characteristics of community structure and niche width of community members has become increasingly common. Although these developments have provided ecologists with new perspectives, their full impact has been hampered by an inability to statistically compare individual communities using descriptive metrics. 2. We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), open up more avenues for direct comparison of isotopic niches across communities. The computational code to calculate the new metrics is implemented in the free-to-download package Stable Isotope Analysis for the R statistical environment.},

abstract = {How do organisms adapt to the differences in temperature and length of the growing season that occur with latitude? Among Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) along the east coast of North America, the length of the first growing season declines by a factor of about 2.5 with increasing latitude. Yet body size at the end of the first growing season does not decline. High-latitude fish must, therefore, grow faster within the growing season than do low-latitude fish. This geographical pattern has a genetic basis. Laboratory experiments on fish from six different locations revealed a latitudinal gradient in the capacity for growth (i.e., maximum growth potential). In two subsequent experiments using fish from Nova Scotia (NS), New York (NY) and South Carolina (SC) that had been separately reared in a common environment for several generations, differences in growth rate among populations were highly significant. The rank order was NS{\textgreater}NY{\textgreater}SC, but the difference among populations depended on temperature. High-latitude fish outperformed those from low latitudes primarily at the high temperatures that low-latitude fish would be expected to experience most often in nature. These results suggest that instead of being adapted for growth at low temperatures, fish from high latitudes are adapted for rapid elevation of growth rate during the brief interval of the year when high temperatures occur. Selection on growth rate results from sizedependent winter mortality: the importance to winter survival of being large increases with latitude but the length of the growing season simultaneously decreases. The end result is countergradient variation in growth rate, a phenomenon that may be much more widespread than currently recognized.},

abstract = {Benthic marine consumers inhabiting the subphotic zone rely on subsidies of energy synthesized by macrophytes and phytoplankton in the photic zone. The effects of this energy subsidy on the trophic ecology of deep invertebrates are generally unknown. We used fatty acids (FA) and multiple stable isotopes (MSI) as trophic biomarkers to compare tissues from conspecifics of primary and secondary consumers in photic and subphotic habitats (15 and 100 m depth) at three sites in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington. FA composition differed across depths for all five species and MSI differed across depths for six of seven species. We found a general pattern of enrichment in $\delta$13C from shallow to deep for all consumers. $\delta$15N was consistently enriched in deep herbivores and suspension feeders, but did not differ in predators. Total $\omega$-3 FA were lower in deep primary consumers, whereas predator $\omega$-3 FA did not differ between depths. Total bacterial marker FA were lower in deep suspension feeders but higher in deep predators. The results suggest a possible mechanism for the differences in FA and enrichment between habitats: deep consumers potentially ingest detritus that has been biochemically altered by microbes during transport. We found support for this hypothetical mechanism in an algal aging experiment. Aged algae colonized by microbes responded with increases in bacterial FA, and decreases in $\omega$-3 FA. This study highlights the power of combining FA and MSI biomarkers, and provides evidence for the importance of organic matter degradation to food web studies.},

abstract = {Blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) plays an important ecological and economic role in estuaries from South America to New England. It supports a large commercial fishery in the United States with approximately one third of the landings taken from Chesapeake Bay. I developed a stage-based matrix model of the blue crab population to address three key questions: What is the ability of blue crab populations to support sustainable exploitations? What stages of the life cycle are most important in regulating the dynamics of the population? And specific to the Chesapeake Bay, what is the importance of a winter dredge fishery in determining long-term sustainability of the crab population? The model indicated that with the current pattern of exploitation blue crab populations are able to sustain a total instantaneous mortality rate (Z) ∼ 0.7. If the natural mortality rate is estimated for a maximum life expectancy of 8 yr, this translates to moderate levels of exploitation (F {\textless} 0.32). This value is less than the current estimate of exploitation in Chesapeake Bay (0.9-1.1) indicating that the level of exploitation in this system needs to be reduced to avoid overfishing. Transitions to and from small age-1 crabs were shown to be important in regulating the overall dynamics of the population. The egg production realized by large adults was also shown to be an important regulatory process. The model indicated that reductions in the winter dredge fishery would have a substantial role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the population. Reductions in other sectors of the fishery are also required to ensure sustainability. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2001 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation},

abstract = {How do organisms adapt to the differences in temperature and length of the growing season that occur with latitude? Among Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) along the east coast of North America, the length of the first growing season declines by a factor of about 2.5 with increasing latitude. Yet body size at the end of the first growing season does not decline. High-latitude fish must, therefore, grow faster within the growing season than do low-latitude fish. This geographical pattern has a genetic basis. Laboratory experiments on fish from six different locations revealed a latitudinal gradient in the capacity for growth (i.e., maximum growth potential). In two subsequent experiments using fish from Nova Scotia (NS), New York (NY) and South Carolina (SC) that had been separately reared in a common environment for several generations, differences in growth rate among populations were highly significant. The rank order was NS{\textgreater}NY{\textgreater}SC, but the difference among populations depended on temperature. High-latitude fish outperformed those from low latitudes primarily at the high temperatures that low-latitude fish would be expected to experience most often in nature. These results suggest that instead of being adapted for growth at low temperatures, fish from high latitudes are adapted for rapid elevation of growth rate during the brief interval of the year when high temperatures occur. Selection on growth rate results from sizedependent winter mortality: the importance to winter survival of being large increases with latitude but the length of the growing season simultaneously decreases. The end result is countergradient variation in growth rate, a phenomenon that may be much more widespread than currently recognized.},

abstract = {Increasing physical oceanographic evidence suggests that a regime shift, which featured increased equatorward surface winds and upwelling in the Eastern Pacific Boundary Current region, occurred following the 1997-1998 El Nino. We expect the signal of this change in biota to be stronger in euphausiids than in pelagic fishes such as Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) because lower trophic levels are more responsive to changes in upwelling and primary production. We used acoustic backscatter data from acoustic surveys in summer 1995, 1998, and 2001 to explore whether significant changes in abundance and distribution of euphausiids and fishes have occurred between 1995 and 2001. Graphical and statistical results show that the density of fish schools and euphausiid patches increased significantly south of Cape Blanco between 1995 and both 1998 and 2001. North of Cape Blanco there was no consistent change in euphausiid abundance, although both fish and euphausiid distributions in 2001 appear to be significantly higher nearshore than in the other years. Pelagic fish abundance distributions appeared more closely linked to El Nino than to regime shifts, with abundance shifted much farther north in 1998, an El Nino year, than in the other years, while 1995 and 2001 fish abundance distributions are similar to each other. The regime shift appears so far to have had a stronger effect on euphausiids than on pelagic fishes. The change in euphausiid abundance and distribution between the survey years was linked, through a conceptual model, to the relative strength of the poleward flowing California undercurrent and equatorward flowing California current and to the distribution and abundance of hake.},

abstract = {Accurate age estimates for Panulirus argus, the commercially important Caribbean spiny lobster, would greatly enhance life history and population analyses. Most age approximations of P. argus are based on size and growth data, but size is generally considered a poor proxy for age of crustaceans in the field because of numerous environmental, density-dependent, and fishery-related factors. An established technique for aging crustaceans, employing histologically determined lipofuscin content in the nervous system, was investigated using known-age lobsters reared in the laboratory at ambient temperatures. We verified the presence of lipofuscin in eyestalk neural tissue by using autofluorescence and Sudan black staining and described its distribution in cell cluster A of the hemiellipsoid body. Neurolipofuscin accumulated with age; the overall trend was linear with indications of seasonal oscillation, whereas growth began to approach an asymptote after 3 years. Differences in the neurolipofuscin concentrations in the two eyestalks from the same animal were statistically insignificant. There was also no difference in the neurolipofuscin concentrations of males and females of the same age. The present data suggest a maximum potential lifespan for P. argus of about 20 years. These results also suggest that the neurolipofuscin technique will be valuable for estimating age of wild-caught specimens of P. argus.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

abstract = {Growth, density, survival, and reproduction were examined for the population of the ghost shrimp. Callianaasa japonica Oftmann, inhabiting all intertidal sandflat in western Kyushu, Japan, based on samples collected from May, 1989 to April, 1991. During the breeding season (June-October) each year, there were two discrete periods of egg production by females. The post- larval settlement, with a time-lag of 1-1.5 months (brooding plus larval developmental periods), generated two major recruitment cohorts, occurring in July-August (Ist cohort) and September November (2nd cohort). The higher growth rate of individuals after recruitment in the 1st cohort enhanced the separation of the two cohorts. Between sexes, the subsequent life history patterns and population characteristics were, for the most part, similar. In females, the majority of individuals of each of the two cohorts matured after approximately one year, respectively, at around a 20-mm total body length, and a portion of these cohorts survived as a fused cohort until June of the second year, breeding again prior to dying off by the end of September. The pattern of growth was an indeterminate type. For each of the two cohorts, the growth rates changed at two transition points of their life history, at around the beginning of their two breeding seasons. The growth rate for the Ist cohort slowed down at the first transition point, while that for the 2nd cohort speeded up there. This led to the approach and fusion of the two cohorts near the second transition point, when growth stopped. During periods other than the breeding seasons, high survival rates were exhibited by the two cohorts. During the first breeding season, a significantly low survival rate was observed for the Ist cohort, but not for the 2nd cohort. The degree of participation in breeding activity may be responsible for the above differences between cohorts. In the two male cohorts, while the cost of reproduction did not reduce the growth rates during the first breeding season, it lowered their survival rates more severely compared to those of females. This may be responsible for the slightly female-biased sex ratio in the population (1.06:1). The density of the population as a whole was stable throughout the study period, with the mean ??SD being 901??157/m2 (n = 27); the adult population declines during the breeding seasons were effectively replenished by recruitment each year.},

abstract = {The fatty acid content of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba from South Georgia was investigated during January and February 1996, a period of relatively low algal biomass. Cluster analysis of the fatty acid data revealed 3 regionally distinct groups of krill. Group A consisted primarily of sub-adults (median length 42 mm) and was characterised by high proportions of 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) fatty acids. Group B comprised mainly juveniles and a small proportion of adults (median length 33 mm) and had a fatty acid profile similar to that of Group A. The largest group, Group C (8 of 14 stations, mostly to the east of the survey area), was almost exclusively juveniles plus a small number of sub-adults (median length 29 mm) and had unusually high percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA; 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) Krill from Group C had the lowest total fatty acid concentrations (150 to 722 mg kg 1). These krill were surviving on the lowest algal biomass in the region and had probably resorted to carnivory on PUFA rich copepods. The pattern of fatty acids in krill from Groups A and B resembled that of krill collected from a diatom bloom in the Bellingshausen Sea, but the concentrations were generally lower. The well fed krill from the Bellingshausen Sea showed small variations in fatty acid content associated with sex and maturity, but the South Georgia results indicated that diet can have a greater impact on fatty acid content than sex and maturity stages. Fatty acid profiles were indicative of food regimes that were so distinct that the krill probably originated from spatially independent groups.},

abstract = {Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Corson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853 USA. Institute for Ecosystem Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, New York 12545 USA The stable isotopes of nitrogen ($\delta$15N) and carbon ($\delta$13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of $\delta$15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of $\delta$13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of $\delta$15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of $\delta$13C when $\delta$13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.

abstract = {The long-standing debate among ecologists as to whether physical factors act in a density-dependent or density-independent fashion may be partially resolved by recognizing that a history of crowding alters an organism's susceptibility to stress. Mortality following sedimentation for sand-flat bivalves is shown to be density-dependent solely because of the historical influence of crowding. Consequently, the density dependence is actually caused by the interaction between the stress of sedimentation and the density history of the organisms. The demonstrated importance of interactions with biotic history raises questions about the interpretation of bioassays, pollutant impacts, responses to weather, paleoecological changes, and results in experimental ecology and physiology whenever the equivalence of organisms is assumed without a knowledge of historical conditioning.},

In spite ofmuchrecent research, no consensus has yet been reached regarding the importance of recruitment relative to other demographic processes in deter- mining local population densities. We argue 1. that demographic theory suggests that, except under restrictive and unlikely conditions, recruitment must influence local population density to some extent. Therefore, 2. the question as to whether the size of a particular population is limited by recruitment is misguided. Finally, 3. the effect of recruitment on population size can be difficult to detect but is nonetheless real. Amajor weakness of most existing studies is a lack of attention to the survival of recruits over appropriate scales of time and space. Acknowl- edgment of the multifactorial determination of population density should guide the design of future experimental studies of the demography of open populations},

Specialized statistical methods, applied to large-scale survey data, aid in testing the theoretical predictions with empirical estimates. Observational studies and experiments on the demography of local populations are paramount to identify the true ecological mechanisms.

@article{Sokolova2012,
abstract = {Energy balance is a fundamental requirement of stress adaptation and tolerance. We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We introduce a versatile model formulation, called the escalator boxcar train, that can be used to study the dynamics of populations structured by age, size, or any other physiological trait.  Spanning the entire spectrum between the classical, age-structured, Leslie matrix models and continuous- time, physiologically structured population models, it combines the computational case of the matrix models with the flexibility of the continuous-time models:  it allows the population dynamics to depend on an arbitrary number of individual characteristics and can account for nonlinear interactions of the population with its (fluctuating) environment, for density dependence in individual behavior, and for a continuous reproduction process.  Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a food-dependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role.  The influence of "growth- curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics.  The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.},

Water-column movements of meiofauna, juvenile insects and marine postlarvae are common and can act to alter greatly local dynamics such as predator-prey and competitive interactions in marine and stream ecosystems. These findings are important because past research on the role of dispersal in invertebrate dynamics has focused almost exclusively on how planktonic larval supply influences the establishment and maintenance of local assemblages, on the colonization of newly opened sites, or on the settlement success of new recruits. The emerging framework is that dispersal needs to be viewed as a regional process that may routinely influence local benthic dynamics, because fauna can move to and from water-column dispersal 'pools' and may do so at frequent intervals.},

abstract = {Sedimentary habitats are complex associations of biotic, chemical, and physical pro- cesses comprising ‘ecosystem function'. The relative importance of these processes to biogeochemi- cal cycling in highly reactive, permeable sediments remains poorly understood. We report results from several field experiments in a muddy-sand intertidal flat dominated by 2 functionally different types of bioturbating macrofauna in False Bay, Washington, USA: (1) the arenicolid polychaete Abarenicola pacifica and (2) 2 species of thalassinid shrimp (Upogebia pugettensis and Neotrypaea californiensis). Experimental plots composed primarily of one of the study taxa or mixed communities of both were evaluated for their effects on porewater advection, solute concentrations, and sediment characteristics. Fluorescein-impregnated acrylamide gels were used to infer rates of transport, and acrylamide gel peepers were used to record porewater concentrations of diagenetically important constituents among experimental plots. Laboratory studies evaluated rates of diffusive transport in non-bioturbated sediments for comparative analysis. We found that (1) functionally different macro- fauna affect rates of porewater advection in permeable sediments, (2) organism effects are not attrib- utable to changes in average measures of sediment granulometry, (3) species interactions may further complicate the advective environment and the resulting diagenetic processes, and (4) species effects vary according to reaction rate kinetics. We hypothesize that species-related effects on trans- port are due to inhibition of arenicolid feeding by thalassinid tubes that serve to block sediment fluidization and advective flow. Thus, specific behaviors and interactions among organisms appear to affect transport rates and sediment function in advectively permeable habitats. The results indicate the importance of integrating behavior, kinetics, and transport into future studies of sedimentary biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Disturbance-mediated species loss has prompted research considering how ecosystem functions are changed when biota is impaired. However, there is still limited empirical evidence from natural environments evaluating the direct and indirect (i.e. via biota) effects of disturbance on ecosystem functioning. Oxygen deficiency is a widespread threat to coastal and estuarine communities. While the negative impacts of hypoxia on benthic communities are well known, few studies have assessed in situ how benthic communities subjected to different degrees of hypoxic stress alter their contribution to ecosystem functioning. We studied changes in sediment ecosystem function (i.e. oxygen and nutrient fluxes across the sediment water-interface) by artificially inducing hypoxia of different durations (0, 3, 7 and 48 days) in a subtidal sandy habitat. Benthic chamber incubations were used for measuring responses in sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Changes in benthic species richness, structure and traits were quantified, while stress-induced behavioral changes were documented by observing bivalve reburial rates. The initial change in faunal behavior was followed by non-linear degradation in benthic parameters (abundance, biomass, bioturbation potential), gradually impairing the structural and functional composition of the benthic community. In terms of ecosystem function, the increasing duration of hypoxia altered sediment oxygen consumption and enhanced sediment effluxes of NH(4)(+) and dissolved Si. Although effluxes of PO(4)(3-) were not altered significantly, changes were observed in sediment PO(4)(3-) sorption capability. The duration of hypoxia (i.e. number of days of stress) explained a minor part of the changes in ecosystem function. Instead, the benthic community and disturbance-driven changes within the benthos explained a larger proportion of the variability in sediment oxygen- and nutrient fluxes. Our results emphasize that the level of stress to the benthic habitat matters, and that the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function is likely to be affected by a range of factors in complex, natural environments.},

abstract = {A series of unusual odd-chain fatty acids (OC-FA) were identified in two thraustochytrid strains, TC 01 and TC 04, isolated from waters off the south east coast of Tasmania, Australia. FA compositions were determined by capillary GC and GC-MS, with confirmation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) structure performed by analysis of 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives. PUFA constituted 68-74{\%} of the total FA, with the essential PUFA; eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5??3, EPA), arachidonic acid (20:4??6, AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6??3, DHA), accounting for 42-44{\%} of the total FA. High proportions of the saturated OC-FA 15:0 (7.1{\%} in TC 01) and 17:0 (6.2{\%} in TC 04) were detected. The OC-FA 17:1??8 was present at 2.8{\%} in TC 01. Of particular interest, the C21 PUFA 21:5??5 and 21:4??7 were detected at 3.5{\%} and 4.1{\%}, respectively, in TC 04. A proposed biosynthesis pathway for these OC-PUFA is presented. It is possible that the unsaturated OC-PUFA found previously in a number of marine animals were derived from dietary thraustochytrids and they could be useful biomarkers in environmental and food web studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},

abstract = {Rebuilding depleted fish populations is a priority of modern fisheries management. In the U.S., strong statutory mandates extend to both the goals and process by which stocks are to be rebuilt. However, the National Standard Guidelines that govern the implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act may change to increase flexibility in rebuilding requirements. In this study we evaluate performance of the status quo approach to fish stock rebuilding in the United States against 3 alternatives that have been proposed to improve rebuilding outcomes. These alternatives either simplify the analytical requirements of rebuilding analyses or apply 'best practices' in fisheries manage-ment, thereby avoiding the need for rebuilding analyses altogether. We use a Management Strategy Evaluation framework to evaluate rebuilding options across 6 fish life history types and 5 possible real-world fishery scenarios that include options for stock assessment quality, multiple fleets, and the degree to which the stocks are overfished at the start of the analysis. We show that the status quo rebuilding plan and a harvest control rule that reduces harvest rates at low stock size generally achieve the best rebuilding outcomes across all life-history types and fishery scenarios. Both approaches constrain fishing in the short term, but achieve high catches in the medium and long term as stocks rebuild to productive levels. These results support a growing body of literature that indicates that efforts to end overfishing early pay off in the medium-to long-term with higher cumulative catches than the alternative.},

Holothurians were rich in phytosterols and algal derived FA such as docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic suggesting tight trophic coupling to phytodetritus. Large proportions of stanols were found, probably a result of enteric bacteria but they may come from sterol metabolism in the holothurians themselves. Oneirophanta mutabilis was distinct with much higher levels of stanols and bacterially derived FA suggesting specific selection of bacteria rich detrital particles or the activity of enteric and integumental bacteria. The ophiuroids sterol and FA compositions differed greatly from the holothurians and reflected consumption of animal material in addition to phytodetritus. Large proportions of energy storage lipids suggested a sporadic food supply. Several unusual fatty acids were found in these abyssal echinoderms. Tetracosahexaenoic acid, 24:6omega3, in ophiuroids and 23:1 in holothurians may be good biomarkers for food web studies. We report the first occurrence of alphaOH 24:1 in holothurians with none detected in ophiuroids. Its function is presently unknown.},

abstract = {In all marine benthic environments, organism replacement depends on recruitment limitation, i.e. the impact of both pre- and post-settlement events on the success of recruitment. The relative contribution of pre- versus post-settlement processes in shaping adult populations has been extensively studied. Most analyses concluded that recruitment limitation is a strong determinant of adults' density. The magnitude of its limitation depends on context, varies with species, and can be strongly modified by all the events preceding and following recruitment itself. A comparison of the outcome of recruitment limitation on hard- and soft-bottom communities has often been neglected. The rules governing these two environments, in both the inter- and the subtidal, might be inferred only by comparing and possibly integrating soft- and hard-bottom ecologies. The highly variable situation that larvae face in the water column is followed by the variability linked to local features, influencing, in its turn, larval settlement and juvenile survival (post-settlement period). A better knowledge of these processes will be possible only by focusing on their relative importance in the two environments and with research on the brief but significant time of larval settlement.

Mer, 39: 175-192) showed that natural mortality rates in fish could be predicted from body growth parameters and environmental temperature but found no evidence for ecological or taxonomic influences. Using an updated database and techniques that avoid some of the earlier analytical problems, we confirm Pauly's conclusion that mortality is correlated with growth and temperature. A path model supports the role of ecological effects on mortality. A phylogenetic effect is also apparent: perciform fishes occupy warmer environments than other species, but in the predator-rich reef habitat they suffer much lower mortality rates. Species that are cryptic or hide in burrows or have morphological defences against predators show the lowest mortality rates.},

The results showed that the ratios of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were respectively -29.8??? to - 26.0??? and 1.6???-5.5??? in the flood season (July), while they were -27.3??? to - 25.6??? and 1.7???-7.8??? in the dry season (February), respectively. The ??13C signatures were remarkably higher in July than in February, and gradually increased from the freshwater areas to the brackish areas. In contrast, there were relatively complex seasonal and spatial changes in stable nitrogen isotopes. It was also reflected that ??15N and C/N compositions had been obviously modified by organic matter diagenesis and biological processing, and could not be used to trace the sources of organic matter at the study area. In addition, it was considered that the mixing inputs of terrigenous and marine materials generally dominated sedimentary organic matter in the intertidal flat. The contribution of terrigenous inputs to sedimentary organic matter was roughly estimated according to the mixing balance model of stable carbon isotopes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sagittal otoliths were removed from individuals (n=1755) sampled from recreational catches and tournament landings. Marginal increment analysis of sectioned otoliths revealed that a single opaque zone formed annually in sagittae from January through May. Fish ages were estimated from the number of opaque zones in otoliths, timing of opaque zone formation, sampling date, and a presumed birthdate of 1 July. Estimated growth of recaptured red snapper (n=288) from a tagging experiment was similar to growth estimated from otolith-aged fish and corroborated otolith aging methods.

abstract = {Statistical mixing models have been developed to help ecologists deal with isotope tracer data and to estimate source contributions in complex systems such as food webs and sediments. However, there are often too few tracer measurements and too many sources, so that unique solutions are not possible in underdetermined mixing models. This review highlights 3 approaches for solving otherwise underdetermined mixing models. The approaches include frequency-based statistics, calculations based on sectors measured in mixing polygons, and linear mixing between central and sidewall points in the mixing polygons. All approaches have some assumptions that allow extrapolation of mean solutions from measured data, with the simplest assumption being that any uncertainty in source contributions is divided in an even-handed manner among sources. A new graphical approach is proposed that allows scientists to critically recognize and separate datasupported aspects of solutions from any assumed aspects of solutions. The data-supported aspects of solutions can be tracked conservatively as the sum of the minimum source contributions, $\Sigma$MIN, and for the many cases where $\Sigma$MIN is low, additional ways to approach mixing problems are summarized from the published literature. Many underdetermined mixing problems do not have robust mean solutions with tracers employed thus far, so that there is a longerterm need for additional tracers and methodologies to really solve these complex ecological problems. This review concludes with several practical steps one can take to interpret isotope tracer information from underdetermined systems.},

abstract = {We use data on the Pleistocene and modern range limits of Californian marine bivalves to show that species that shifted their geographical ranges in response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations were preferentially drawn from the large end of the regional body size–frequency distributions. This difference is not due to phylogenetic effects (i.e. dominance of extralimital species by a few large-bodied clades), differences among major ecological categories (burrowing versus surface-dwelling, or suspension feeding versus non-suspension feeding), or differences in modes of reproduction and larval development. In addition, we show that successful invasive species of bivalves in present-day marine habitats also tend to be large-bodied, despite the difference in mechanisms between present-day and Pleistocene range expansions. These results indicate that range limits of large-bodied bivalve species are more unstable than small-bodied ones, and that body size and its correlates need to be considered when attempting to predict the responses of marine communities to climate change, biotic interchanges and human-mediated invasions.},

Laboratory-reared individuals were fed one of three monoalgal diets at different stages of growth: the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the flagellate Rhodomonas lens and the dinoflagellte Prorocentrum minimum. The diet was analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, protein, carbohydrate and fatty acid content. Reproductive success was measured as eggs female-1 day-1 (E r) and as the hatching success of the eggs. The E r of Acartia spp. was correlated with protein and specific fatty acids [16:1$\omega$7 (negative), 20:5$\omega$3, 22:6$\omega$3, and 18:0 (positive)] and, especially, the fatty acid composition of the algae expressed as the $\omega$3:$\omega$6 and 20:22 fatty acid ratios. The youngest diatom cultures and exponentially-growing flagellates displayed the highest E r; the lowest E r was recorded for females fed the senescent diatom cultures. The development time of eggs was affected by the age of the phytoplankton culture fed to the female. Hatching success of eggs decreased with the age of the algal culture, but no correlation was found with the meansured chemical components of the food.},

abstract = {The position of meroplanktonic larvae in the water column with depth-dependent current velocities determines horizontal transport trajectories. For those larvae occurring in inner shelf waters, little is known about how combined diel and tidally-synchronized vertical migration patterns shift ontogenetically. The vertical migration of larvae of Nihonotrypaea harmandi (Decapoda: Thalassinidea: Callianassidae) was investigated in mesotidal, inner shelf waters of western Kyushu, Japan in July-August 2006. The larval sampling at seven depth layers down to 60 m was conducted every 3 h for 36 h in a 68.5-m deep area 10 km off a major coastal adult habitat. Within a 61-65-m deep area 5-7.5 km off the adult habitat, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, and photon flux density were measured, and water currents there were characterized from harmonic analysis of current meter data collected in 2008. The water column was stratified, with pycnocline, chlorophyll a concentration maximum, and 2{\%} of photon flux density at 2 m, recorded at around 22-24 m. The stratified residual currents were detected in their north component, directed offshore and onshore in the upper and lower mixed layers, respectively. More than 87{\%} of larvae occurred between 20 m and 60 m, producing a net onshore transport of approximately 1.3 km d-1. At the sunset flooding tide, all zoeal-stage larvae ascended, which could further promote retention (1.4-km potential onshore transport in 3 h). The actual onshore transport of larvae was detected by observing their occurrence pattern in a shallow embayment area with the adult habitat for 24 h in October 1994. However, ontogenetic differences in the vertical migration pattern in inner shelf waters were also apparent, with the maximum mean positions of zoeae deepening with increasing stages. Zoeae I and II performed a reverse diel migration, with their minimum and maximum depths being reached around noon and midnight, respectively. Zoeae IV and V descended continuously. Zoeae III had behaviors that were intermediate to those of the earlier- and later-stage zoeae. Postlarvae underwent a normal diel migration (nocturnal ascent) regardless of tides, with the deepest position (below 60 m and/or on the bottom) during the day. These findings give a new perspective towards how complex vertical migration patterns in meroplanktonic larvae enable their retention in inner shelf waters before the final entry of postlarvae into their natal populations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of three spatial scales, 10s of metres (sites), 1000s of metres (shores) and 100s of kilometers (locations), was determined. The largest spatial scale represented the distance between four widely separated locations, Sweden, the Isle of Man, SW Ireland and SW England, covering a large part of the range of S. balanoides in Europe. Temporal variation was determined by comparison between two years, 1997 and 1998. The settlement period of S. balanoides varied in length and timing, being earlier and shorter at the most northerly location, Sweden. The duration of settlement showed little difference among shores within locations, but the pattern of settlement did vary. Estimates of total settlement throughout the settlement period and of recruitment at the end of this period both showed substantial variation among locations which was dependent on the year of study. There was little consistency in the ranking of locations between the two years. Recruitment showed significant variation at the lower spatial scales of shore and site. In addition, examination of variance components showed a high degree of variation between replicates within sites in 1997. There was a significant relationship between settlement and recruitment at three of the four locations. Across all locations variation in settlement explained between 29 and 99{\%} of variation in recruitment. However, locations showed distinct differences in the level of post-settlement survival.},

abstract = {Effective population size (N(e)) is a central evolutionary concept, but its genetic estimation can be significantly complicated by age structure. Here we investigate N(e) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations that have undergone changes in demography and population dynamics, applying four different genetic estimators. For this purpose we use genetic data (14 microsatellite markers) from archived scale samples collected between 1951 and 2004. Through life table simulations we assess the genetic consequences of life history variation on N(e). Although variation in reproductive contribution by mature parr affects age structure, we find that its effect on N(e) estimation may be relatively minor. A comparison of estimator models suggests that even low iteroparity may upwardly bias N(e) estimates when ignored (semelparity assumed) and should thus empirically be accounted for. Our results indicate that N(e) may have changed over time in relatively small populations, but otherwise remained stable. Our ability to detect changes in N(e) in larger populations was, however, likely hindered by sampling limitations. An evaluation of N(e) estimates in a demographic context suggests that life history diversity, density-dependent factors, and metapopulation dynamics may all affect the genetic stability of these populations.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is used frequently to determine the relative contributions of different food sources to an animal's diet (Hobson 1999). Isotopic ratios for the ani- mal tissues and each of its potential food sources are de- termined. The similarity of the ratios for the animal tis- sues with those of individual food sources (after correct- ing for fractionation during digestion and assimilation) gives an idea of their relative importance in the diet; in other words “you are what you eat” (DeNiro and Epstein 1978). Two food sources can be partitioned using the isotopic ratio for a single element (e.g., $\delta$ 13 C), or three food sources can be partitioned using isotopic ratios for two elements (e.g., $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 15 N) (Kwak and Zedler 1997). A number of recent papers have used geometric procedures to quantify the contributions of three food sources to the diet using $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 15 N (Ben-David et al. 1997a, 1997b; Kline et al. 1993; Szepanski et al. 1999; Whitledge and Rabeni 1997). However, these methods do not provide correct solutions to this three-endmember mixing problem. The purpose of this paper is to point out the shortcomings of these methods and to propose an al- ternative procedure which avoids them. Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the ana- lytical situation. The dietary isotopic composition is rep- resented by point D within the triangle bounded by the points for the adjusted food source isotopic compositions A ′ , B ′ , and C ′ . In the geometric procedures, Euclidean distances are calculated for line segments DA ′ , DB ′ , and DC ′ and are used to compute the dietary contributions. Several variations of this calculation have been utilized. Kline et al. (1993) used the following equation},

abstract = {Multiple natural and anthropogenic processes alter the carbonate chemistry of the coastal zone in ways that either exacerbate or mitigate ocean acidification effects. Freshwater inputs and multiple acid-base reactions change carbonate chemistry conditions, sometimes synergistically. The shallow nature of these systems results in strong benthic-pelagic coupling, and marine invertebrates at different life history stages rely on both benthic and pelagic habitats. Carbonate chemistry in coastal systems can be highly variable, responding to processes with temporal modes ranging from seconds to centuries. Identifying scales of variability relevant to levels of biological organization requires a fuller characterization of both the frequency and magnitude domains of processes contributing to or reducing acidification in pelagic and benthic habitats. We review the processes that contribute to coastal acidification with attention to timescales of variability and habitats relevant to marine bivalves.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of population dynamics requires detailed studies on habitat selection and spatial distribution. Although small pelagic fish aggregate in large shoals and usually exhibit important spatial structure, their dynamics in time and space remain unpredictable and challenging. In the Gulf of Lions (north-western Mediterranean), sardine and anchovy biomasses have declined over the past 5 years causing an important fishery crisis while sprat abundance rose. Applying geostatistical tools on scientific acoustic surveys conducted in the Gulf of Lions, we investigated anchovy, sardine and sprat spatial distributions and structures over 10 years. Our results show that sardines and sprats were more coastal than anchovies. The spatial structure of the three species was fairly stable over time according to variogram outputs, while year-to-year variations in kriged maps highlighted substantial changes in their location. Support for the McCall's basin hypothesis (covariation of both population density and presence area with biomass) was found only in sprats, the most variable of the three species. An innovative method to investigate species collocation at different scales revealed that globally the three species strongly overlap. Although species often co-occurred in terms of presence/absence, their biomass density differed at local scale, suggesting potential interspecific avoidance or different sensitivity to local environmental characteristics. Persistent favourable areas were finally detected, but their environmental characteristics remain to be determined.},

abstract = {Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7{\%}) and C/N ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen (TN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-grain size relationship. This suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55{\%} of the TOC and 0.6-35{\%} of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 × 1011 g C yr-1 and 2.3 × 1010 g N yr-1, respectively, with corresponding accumulation rates of 1.1-1.5 × 1010 g C yr-1 and 4.4-5.8 × 108 g N yr-1 at the present time. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Mean (±SD) growth rates ranged from 0.04 ± 0.03 to 0.56 ± 0.1 mm d–1 at 5 and 25°C, respectively. Unexpectedly, the catch date also influenced growth rates, indicating that recently recruited animals grew faster than overwintering shrimps of the same size. Female shrimps of the recent recruitment wave showed significantly higher growth rates than male shrimps. Individual moult intervals were determined using a marking method. Mean intervals (±SD) varied between 8 ± 3.6 and 45 ± 7.6 d for 30 mm shrimps at 25 and 5°C, respectively. Temperature and length affected the moult interval but not the moult increment. Variability in the observed growth rates at a given length and temperature was mainly an effect of variable moult increments. Results from 2 pre-experiments also indicate an effect of food quality on growth, with shrimps growing faster when feeding on live copepods in comparison to several other food sources.},

abstract = {Aim Variation partitioning based on canonical analysis is the most commonly used analysis to investigate community patterns according to environmental and spatial predictors. Ecologists use this method in order to understand the pure contribution of the environment independent of space, and vice versa, as well as to control for inflated type I error in assessing the environmental component under spatial autocorrelation. Our goal is to use numerical simulations to compare how different spatial predictors and model selection procedures perform in assessing the importance of the spatial component and in controlling for type I error while testing environmental predictors.Innovation We determine for the first time how the ability of commonly used (polynomial regressors) and novel methods based on eigenvector maps compare in the realm of spatial variation partitioning. We introduce a novel forward selection procedure to select spatial regressors for community analysis. Finally, we point out a number of issues that have not been previously considered about the joint explained variation between environment and space, which should be taken into account when reporting and testing the unique contributions of environment and space in patterning ecological communities.Main conclusions In tests of species-environment relationships, spatial autocorrelation is known to inflate the level of type I error and make the tests of significance invalid. First, one must determine if the spatial component is significant using all spatial predictors (Moran's eigenvector maps). If it is, consider a model selection for the set of spatial predictors (an individual-species forward selection procedure is to be preferred) and use the environmental and selected spatial predictors in a partial regression or partial canonical analysis scheme. This is an effective way of controlling for type I error in such tests. Polynomial regressors do not provide tests with a correct level of type I error.},

abstract = {Integral Projection Models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's state influences its vital rates - survival, growth and reproduction - to make population projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates from state variables (e.g., size or age) and covariates (e.g., environment). By combining regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions, or life history strategies. Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be applied to any stage-structured population; here we illustrate IPMs for a series of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species' geographic distributions and life history strategies. IPMs can represent a wide range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover, IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for Matrix Projection Models. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous estimates of suspended food resources have not incorporated the hydrodynamics of species-specific food entrainment. To assess food resources available to the siphonate bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria, we developed an in situ sampling protocol utilizing realistic incurrent siphon characteristics (e.g. diameter, sampling height and pumping rate) with simultaneous measurements of the current velocity profile. Microalgal food resources, as estimated by clam-biased chlorophyll a measurements, varied 10-fold over both temporal (hourly and seasonally) and spatial (centimeter and meter) scales in estuarine vegetated and adjacent unvegetated habitats. For the near bottom (1 cm height) samples, chlorophyll a concentrations and variations were greater in a seagrass bed than those measured in the adjoining bare sand habitat. Samples collected at 5, 15, and 45 cm above the bottom did not exhibit any habitat-specific pattern. Up to 90{\%} of the near-bottom microalgal count in the seagrass bed was pennate diatoms suggesting that much of the chlorophyll a is derived from the bed. Current speeds measured just above the bottom in the seagrass bed were considerably lower ( lt 1 cm s-1) than elsewhere. These results suggest a relatively concentrated, locally-generated near-bottom food resource for M. mercenaria within the vegetated habitat. Therefore, resource depletion (i.e. suspension feeders reducing the food level for others downstream) may not be relevant to hard clam populations at this site.},

@article{Payne2009,
abstract = {In the art of fish-stock assessment, it is common practice to include all available data without properly testing their validity in terms of their signal-to-noise ratio. The western Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) stock has been historically difficult to assess in a reliable manner. The population is spread between the Skagerrak, Kattegat, the Danish islands, and the western Baltic, but the distribution depends on age and season. Although the distribution area is covered by five separate surveys, none covers the entire stock. Using all time-series data may cause high noise levels and could lead to a poor-quality assessment. We examine the temporal and spatial coverage of each survey in terms of current biological understanding of stock distribution and, employing the observed internal consistency between age classes within cohorts as additional criteria, select the most appropriate data subsets. Assessments based on the revised dataset show greatly improved quality in terms of both accuracy and precision. The results highlight the often-ignored principle that a judicious choice of input data, based on rational and justifiable selection criteria, can enhance the ultimate quality of a stock assessment.},

The diet of predatory skates (Alaska skate, Aleutian skate, whiteblotched skate, and B. matsubarai) consisted of large crustaceans, cephalopods and fishes. Benthophagic skates (sandpaper skate, Okhotsk skate, and probably whitebrow skate) consumed mainly amphipods and worms. The consumption of worms and crustaceans (especially small crustaceans) in diets of preda- tory skates declined with increasing skate size, whereas cephalopod and fish frequency of occurrence increased. For benthophage skates occurrence of amphipods in stomachs declined with increasing skate size and consumption of shrimps and other large crustaceans, as well as squids, increased.},
