## Welcome to the SPASAM project

This repository contains the the development versions of the SPATIAL MODELS CODE for the SPASAM project. Folders in this repository contain code and files specific to the individual manuscripts.

### Spatial_BRP_project 
* Spatially-explicit operating model used for determining biological reference points (ie MSY, depletion, etc) for populations with complex spatial structure. Also allows for spatial variation in harvest.

### Tag-integrated_model
* Spatially-explicit, tag-integrated operating and estimation models used evaluate the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates under various levels of data quality and/ or model mispsecification.  Two separate studies are currently planned with these models, one with a recruitment focus and the other with a data quantity/quality focus.

### Management Boundaries
* This project will evaluate consequences of the mismatch between spatial boundaries delinated by state/fedreal management procedures and the true geographic extent of the harvested population/s with complex spatial structure and life history. We will get there eventually...
