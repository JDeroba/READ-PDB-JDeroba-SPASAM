This repository contains the development versions of the SPATIAL MODELS CODE for the SPASAM project. Folders in this repository contain code and files specific to the individual studies.

### Spatial_BRP_project 
* Spatially-explicit operating model used for determining biological reference points (ie MSY, depletion, etc) for populations with complex spatial structure. Also allows for spatial variation in harvest.

### Tag-Integrated_Model
* Spatially-explicit, tag-integrated operating and estimation models used evaluate the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates under various levels of data quality and/ or model mispsecification.  Two separate studies are currently planned with these models, one with a recruitment focus and the other with a data quantity/quality focus.

### Management_Boundaries
* This project will evaluate consequences of the mismatch between spatial boundaries delinated by state/federal/initernational management procedures and the true geographic extent of the harvested population/s with complex spatial structure and life history. We will get there eventually...
